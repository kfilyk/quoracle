Espec\u00edficamente, esta teor\u00eda es la tesis de MOASS (Mother Of All Short Squeezes).\n\nLa intenci\u00f3n principal de la publicaci\u00f3n es resumir la tesis MOASS para los inversores que no est\u00e1n completamente actualizados, as\u00ed como para aquellos que son m\u00e1s nuevos en el mercado de valores en general y est\u00e1n interesados \u200b\u200ben invertir. Dicho esto, este art\u00edculo NO pretende servir como fuente de prueba / evidencia detr\u00e1s de esta teor\u00eda, y opera bajo el supuesto de que la teor\u00eda es v\u00e1lida y que se cumplen las condiciones sobre las que se basa. Para aquellos que pretenden profundizar en la evidencia que respalda la teor\u00eda, existe una gran cantidad de investigaci\u00f3n y diligencia debida que se ha realizado y documentado en torno a esta teor\u00eda, aunque se recomienda utilizar este documento para obtener una comprensi\u00f3n b\u00e1sica antes de profundizar en la debida diligencia.\n\n**Posici\u00f3n larga (**[Long Position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp)**) / Compra &amp;amp;amp;amp; Venta de acciones** **(Buying &amp;amp;amp;amp; Selling Stocks)**\n\nCuando un inversor compra una acci\u00f3n, se considera largo en ella, es decir, los poseedores de posiciones largas tienen un n\u00famero de acciones **positivo**. Para cerrar una posici\u00f3n larga, el propietario vender\u00eda sus acciones en el mercado de valores. La idea b\u00e1sica detr\u00e1s de obtener una posici\u00f3n larga es:\n\n1. Compre las acciones.\n2. Mant\u00e9nga las acciones en su cuenta hasta que su precio aumente a la cantidad deseada.\n3. V\u00e9ndalas para obtener ganancias.\n\nCuando las personas piensan en comprar y vender acciones, generalmente se refieren a *abrir* y *cerrar* posiciones largas.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Posici\u00f3n corta (**[Short Position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp)**) / Vender en corto(Short Selling) / Cobertura de existencias (Covering Stock)**\n\nCuando un vendedor en corto mantiene una posici\u00f3n corta en la acci\u00f3n, (que es esencialmente el polo opuesto de una posici\u00f3n larga.) est\u00e1n efectivamente endeudados o deben la cantidad de acciones que han vendido en corto, y pueden considerarse **negativos** en la acci\u00f3n. Eventualmente, para cerrar esa posici\u00f3n, los vendedores en corto deben comprar una cantidad de acciones igual al tama\u00f1o de su posici\u00f3n corta (comprar para cerrar una posici\u00f3n corta se conoce como cobertura). Las posiciones cortas deben informarse a los reguladores (a diferencia de las *ventas cortas al descubierto*) La idea b\u00e1sica de obtener una posici\u00f3n corta en una acci\u00f3n es:\n\n1. Pedir prestada una acci\u00f3n propiedad de un prestamista.\n2. Vender las acciones que se tomaron prestadas y obtener la ganancia acorde al precio que ten\u00edan en el momento en que se hizo  \"la venta en corto\". Tambien se paga intereses como un porcentaje del valor de las acciones. Dado que se trata de un porcentaje, el costo de los intereses aumenta si aumenta el valor de la acci\u00f3n.\n3. Mantenga la posici\u00f3n hasta que el precio haya bajado al precio deseado.\n4. Compre las acciones en el mercado abierto.\u00b7 . Idealmente, las acciones se vuelven a comprar a un precio m\u00e1s bajo del que originalmente se pidi\u00f3 prestado para que el inversor pueda quedarse con la diferencia.\n5. Devuelva la parte al prestamista.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**La Flota (**[The Float](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-companys-float/)**)**\n\nEs la cantidad de acciones que est\u00e1n disponibles para cotizar en la bolsa (la cantidad de acciones en circulaci\u00f3n menos la cantidad de acciones restringidas que son propiedad de personas con informaci\u00f3n privilegiada, por ejemplo los miembros de la mesa directiva de la compa\u00f1ia correspondiente). En teor\u00eda, el n\u00famero de acciones propiedad de inversores minoristas e inversores institucionales no puede superar la flota total.\n\nSPOILER: Se cree que GME tiene una propiedad que asciende del 200% al 400% de la flota, si no es que m\u00e1s, debido a algo llamado *venta en corto al descubierto (Naked short selling)*, que es una parte clave de la tesis, pero m\u00e1s sobre eso m\u00e1s adelante. La flota total de GME es actualmente de \\~ 56,89 millones de acciones, es importante tener en cuenta que los inversores institucionales poseen entre 25 y 30 millones de acciones flotantes. Si las instituciones se mantuvieran durante el MOASS (no es una garant\u00eda, aunque se espera que muchas lo hagan), entonces la cantidad de acciones p\u00fablicamente ser\u00eda de alrededor de \\~ 25M-30M, lo que significa que habr\u00eda incluso menos oferta cuando los vendedores en corto finalmente tengan que cubrir sus pocisiones .\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Invesores minoristas (**[Retail Inverstors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp)**)**\n\nLos inversores minoristas, tambi\u00e9n conocidos como inversores individuales, son sus inversores medios (no una empresa u organizaci\u00f3n).\n\n**Inversores institucionales (**[Institutional Investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp)**)**\n\nLos inversores institucionales son organizaciones que invierten en nombre de las personas. Ejemplos de inversores institucionales son fondos de dotaci\u00f3n, bancos comerciales, fondos mutuos, fondos de cobertura, fondos de pensiones y compa\u00f1\u00edas de seguros\n\n**Creadores de mercado (**[Market Makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)**)**\n\nLos creadores de mercado son muy diferentes de los \"inversores\" y son un poco m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de explicar, pero b\u00e1sicamente est\u00e1n ah\u00ed para aumentar la liquidez en el mercado. Cuando compra y vende acciones, esas transacciones a menudo se realizan entre usted y un creador de mercado. Los creadores de mercado obtienen \"reglas especiales\" que les permiten mantener liquidez en el mercado cuando hay poca liquidez. El vender en corto al descubierto es una de las opciones que tienen los creadores de mercado cuando navegan por una operaci\u00f3n que otros inversores no tienen.\n\n**Venta en corto al descubierto (**[Naked Short Selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)**)**\n\nLa venta en corto al descubierto permite efectivamente a un formador de mercado vender en corto una acci\u00f3n sin tener una acci\u00f3n prestada como ocurre con las ventas cortas normales. El resultado es similar a una venta corta. Las ventas en corto al descubierto, **NO** tienen que ser reportadas de la misma manera que las \"Ventas cortas\" normales y pueden \"*ocultarse*\". Se espera que GME est\u00e9 en corto alrededor de **dos a cuatro veces la flota total de acciones**, a pesar de que el inter\u00e9s corto solo representa \\~ 20% de la flota, lo que significa que la mayor\u00eda de las acciones est\u00e1n en corto a trav\u00e9s de una posici\u00f3n corta al descubierto. Este tipo de comercio es ilegal fuera de situaciones espec\u00edficas que involucren a los creadores de mercado. Debido a una laguna jur\u00eddica y a la falta de supervisi\u00f3n por parte de la regulaci\u00f3n, las ventas en corto al descubierto se pueden utilizar para manipular el precio de ciertas acciones. La venta en corto al descubierto fue el objetivo de una regulaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s estricta durante la crisis financiera del 2008, pero lamentablemente, la aplicaci\u00f3n no ha sido eficaz para evitar que se manipule el mercado de valores.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Acciones sint\u00e9ticas (Synthetic Shares)**\n\nLas acciones sint\u00e9ticas son los instrumentos financieros que se producen mediante las ventas al descubierto. A menudo denominadas acciones \"falsificadas\" (aunque pueden denominarse as\u00ed, son tan leg\u00edtimas como una acci\u00f3n no sint\u00e9tica). Las acciones sint\u00e9ticas otorgan al propietario los mismos derechos que un inversionista que posee una acci\u00f3n no sint\u00e9tica. Los casos en los que existe una cantidad excesiva de acciones sint\u00e9ticas apuntan a la posibilidad de que se est\u00e9 abusando o manipulando una acci\u00f3n.\n\n**Margen (**[Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp)**)**\n\nEl margen es b\u00e1sicamente cr\u00e9dito que un inversor puede utilizar para comprar m\u00e1s acciones. Cuando compra con margen, debe apostar los activos que ya ha comprado con su propio efectivo como colateral. La cantidad de Margen que puede tener depende del valor de su colateral. El valor de su colateral y efectivo, debe cumplir con los requisitos de margen para continuar comprando con margen. Tenga en cuenta que el valor de su colateral puede cambiar si el precio sube o baja, y si el valor de su colateral / efectivo cae por debajo del requisito de margen, recibir\u00e1 una llamada de margen.\n\nOtra forma de pensarlo (mejor ejemplo en el encabezado Margin Call debajo de este):\n\n1. Imagina que tengo $ 1,000 en acciones.\n2. Obtienes un pr\u00e9stamo personal por otros $ 1000. Para obtener el cr\u00e9dito, usted apuesta sus $ 1000 en acciones (si no cumple, el prestamista lo recibe para cubrir su deuda).\n3. Compra $ 1000 m\u00e1s acciones con ese pr\u00e9stamo (ahora posee $ 2000 en acciones, la mitad en efectivo, la mitad en margen). Pagar\u00e1 intereses sobre los $1000 de margen, pero si su inversi\u00f3n genera m\u00e1s dinero que los intereses, entonces todav\u00eda est\u00e1 obteniendo ganancias. Si su inversi\u00f3n se vuelve mala (digamos que el precio de sus acciones cae un 50% y le quedan $ 1000), su prestamista puede cerrar sus posiciones a la fuerza (todo lo que compr\u00f3 en efectivo y apostado como garant\u00eda junto con lo que compr\u00f3 con margen, por lo que que pueden recuperar los $ 1000 que te prestaron).\n\n**Llamada de Margen (**[Margin Call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp)**)**\n\nUna llamada de margen es un aviso que indica que tiene una cantidad espec\u00edfica de tiempo para depositar suficientes fondos propios para cumplir con su requisito de margen (si no puede cumplir con el requisito, el prestamista tiene derecho a vender todas sus tenencias para recuperar lo que pidi\u00f3 prestado.\n\nEjemplos: Este es un escenario un poco complicado que puede ser un poco dif\u00edcil de seguir. Dale algunas lecturas si no tiene sentido la primera vez, pero b\u00e1sicamente, Margin es una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito que puedes usar para comprar m\u00e1s activos (efectivamente, un pr\u00e9stamo respaldado por una garant\u00eda y efectivo en tu propia cuenta). Si compra activos con \u00e9l, tiene que devolver lo que pidi\u00f3 prestado, ya sea que el valor de su inversi\u00f3n suba o baje (si la inversi\u00f3n aumenta de valor, usted gana m\u00e1s de lo que normalmente ganar\u00eda, pero si la inversi\u00f3n baja en valor, pierde m\u00e1s de lo que tendr\u00eda sin margen). Esto se vuelve a\u00fan m\u00e1s (o menos quiz\u00e1s) complicado cuando tiene posiciones cortas Y posiciones largas, como la mayor\u00eda de los inversores institucionales. Para tener posiciones cortas, todav\u00eda necesito tener margen, pero no necesito usarlo para comprar acciones. Puede actuar como un amortiguador si tengo una posici\u00f3n corta en una acci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 aumentando de valor (con una posici\u00f3n corta, si el precio de algo que corto sube, estoy perdiendo dinero), y si sube demasiado, puede ir en contra de mi l\u00ednea de margen, provocando una llamada de margen.\n\n**Ejemplo de margen positivo: (solo posiciones largas):**\n\n1. Imagina que tengo $ 1000 en acciones X (digamos 10 acciones por valor de $ 100 cada una)\n2. Mi corredor puede prestarme una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito de margen igual al valor de mis activos (es decir, $ 1000 de margen), y digamos que me dan un requisito de margen de $ 800, lo que significa que el valor de mis activos sin margen (los que yo comprado con mi dinero) debe estar por encima de $ 800 para seguir usando el margen (de modo que mientras la acci\u00f3n X se mantenga por encima de $ 80 por acci\u00f3n, no recibir\u00e9 una llamada de margen por estar por debajo del requisito)\n3. Entonces elijo usar el margen, comprando 10 acciones m\u00e1s de la acci\u00f3n X por $100 cada una, por lo que ahora tengo 20 acciones de la acci\u00f3n X, valoradas en $100  la pieza.\n4. Si el precio de las acciones X sube al 25% por acci\u00f3n y vendo las 20 acciones, acabo de obtener una ganancia de $ 500 (+ $ 25 en 20 acciones)una. En este caso, cerrar la posici\u00f3n me libera de la deuda de margen, ya que ya no la uso en una posici\u00f3n abierta. Si no hubiera usado el margen, solo me hubiera ido con $ 250 en ganancias ($ 25 por acci\u00f3n en 10 acciones), pero en cambio gan\u00e9 $ 500 y devolv\u00ed el cr\u00e9dito, m\u00e1s un poco de inter\u00e9s.\n5. Esto es bueno.\n\n**Ejemplo de margen negativo (solo posiciones largas):**\n\n1. Imagina que tengo $ 1000 en acciones X (digamos 10 acciones por valor de $ 100 cada una)\n2. Mi corredor puede prestarme una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito de margen igual al valor de mis activos (es decir, $ 1000 de margen), y digamos que me dan un requisito de margen de $ 800, lo que significa que el valor de mis activos sin margen (los que yo comprado con mi dinero) debe estar por encima de $ 800 para seguir usando el margen (de modo que mientras la acci\u00f3n X se mantenga por encima de $ 80 por acci\u00f3n, no recibir\u00e9 una llamada de margen por estar por debajo del requisito)\n3. Entonces elijo usar el margen, comprando 10 acciones m\u00e1s de la acci\u00f3n X por $100 cada una, por lo que ahora tengo 20 acciones de la acci\u00f3n X, valoradas en $100  la pieza.\n4. Si el precio de las acciones X baja un 25%, lo que reduce el valor por acci\u00f3n a $ 75 por acci\u00f3n, el valor de mi posici\u00f3n total es ahora de $ 1500 y el valor de mis activos sin margen es de $ 750, que est\u00e1 por debajo del requisito de margen (tenga en cuenta que ped\u00ed prestados $ 1000, por lo que sigue siendo el monto que tengo que devolver)\n5. Mi prestamista me dar\u00e1 una llamada de margen, indicando que tengo dos d\u00edas h\u00e1biles para depositar 50 $ en mi cuenta a fin de cumplir con el requisito de margen. Si tengo el efectivo para depositar los $ 50 adicionales, mis activos ascender\u00edan a $ 800 ($ 750 en acciones X + 50 $ en efectivo). Si el precio de la acci\u00f3n X se recupera por encima de $ 80 por acci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda satisfacer el requisito. Si no tengo el efectivo para depositar, entonces estoy en problemas, ya que despu\u00e9s de dos d\u00edas, se les permite liquidar (vender) los activos que compr\u00e9 con mi propio dinero, as\u00ed como los activos que compr\u00e9 al margen. Digamos que esto sucede, todos mis activos prestados se venden primero para cubrir mi pr\u00e9stamo de $ 1000 (dado que el precio de la acci\u00f3n X era de solo $ 750, solo cubre $ 750 de mi l\u00ednea de margen de $ 1000. Ahora me quedan $ 750 en activos de la acci\u00f3n X, pero todav\u00eda debo dinero del margen, por lo que mi prestamista tiene derecho a vender $ 250 del trabajo de mis acciones para recuperar sus $ 1000 completos.iii. Ahora me quedan $ 500 en total ($ 750 en 10 acciones X - $ 250)\n6. Esto no es bueno.\n\n**Ejemplo de margen negativo (posiciones largas y posiciones cortas):**\n\n***ESTE ES EL RELEVANTE PARA GME***\n\n1. Imagina que tengo $ 1000 en acciones X (digamos 10 acciones por valor de $ 100 cada una)\n2. Mi corredor puede prestarme una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito de margen igual al valor de mis activos (es decir, $ 1000 de margen), y digamos que me dan un requisito de margen de $ 800, lo que significa que el valor de mis activos sin margen (los que yo comprado con mi dinero) debe ser superior a $ 800 para seguir usando el margen.\n3. En lugar de usar el margen para comprar m\u00e1s, corto 10 acciones de la acci\u00f3n Y, que actualmente est\u00e1 a $ 50 por acci\u00f3n (lo que me da $ 500 en efectivo adicional), que utilizo para comprar 5 acciones m\u00e1s de la acci\u00f3n Xuna. Ahora tengo 15 acciones X valoradas en $ 1500 y corto 10 acciones Y valoradas en - $ 500 ($ 500 negativos) por un valor neto de $ 1000B. Ning\u00fan margen est\u00e1 comprometido activamente con las posiciones abiertas, y todav\u00eda estoy usando mis $ 1000\n4. Ahora, digamos que ocurre un peque\u00f1o aprieto en la acci\u00f3n Y, lo que hace que el precio se dispare a 200 d\u00f3lares por acci\u00f3n.una. Mi posici\u00f3n corta es ahora - $ 2000 (10 acciones de - $ 200 cada una)\n5. El valor neto de mi cuenta ahora es de $ -500 ($ 1500 - $ 2000), que ahora usa mi margen, y debido a que el valor de mi cuenta ya no supera los $ 800, ya no cumplo con los requisitos de margen, por lo que obtengo una llamada de margen.\n6. Si no puedo equilibrar mi cuenta, el prestamista liquidar\u00e1 mis $ 1500 en acciones X para pagar los - $ 2000 que debo, dej\u00e1ndome con - $ 500 restantes en deuda.una. Ahora he incumplido, ya que no puedo pagar los $ 500\n7. Ahora que he incumplido, el prestamista que me dio el margen es due\u00f1o de mis posiciones cortas, lo que significa que ahora est\u00e1n cortas en lo que quedaba. El prestamista ahora puede navegar por las posiciones cortas como quiera (puede retenerlas y esperar que el precio baje, y cubrirlas para cerrarlas, o pueden cerrarlas inmediatamente, lo que les cuesta los $ 500 que todav\u00eda debo).\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Apret\u00f3n corto (**[Short Squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)**)**\n\nUn Short Squeeze es un evento de mercado que ocurre cuando hay una gran posici\u00f3n corta en una acci\u00f3n cuyo precio aumenta r\u00e1pidamente por encima de lo esperado, normalmente debido a un catalizador. Durante el apreton corto, las p\u00e9rdidas de quienes tienen posiciones cortas contin\u00faan aumentando al alza. Dado que deben acciones, el costo para cubrir su posici\u00f3n aumenta dependiendo de qu\u00e9 tan alto suba el precio (te\u00f3ricamente no hay l\u00edmite sobre qu\u00e9 tan alto puede subir una acci\u00f3n). A medida que los participantes del mercado que est\u00e1n cortos de acciones compran para cubrir, la oferta disminuye y la demanda aumenta, lo que hace que el precio aumente a\u00fan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente. Mientras que los vendedores en corto luchan por cubrir sus posiciones, el r\u00e1pido cambio de precio puede atraer a los inversores que no est\u00e1n cortos en las acciones a comprarlas para obtener una ganancia r\u00e1pida. Nuevamente, reduciendo la oferta y aumentando la demanda.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**La Madre de Todos los Apretones Cortos (The Mother of All Short Squeezes \"MOASS\") Explicacion-**\n\nAhora que ya repasamos los terminos importantes, nos podemos enfocar en la teoria del \"MOASS\"\n\nDebido a las posiciones cortas y al descubierto en GME por parte de participantes en el Mercado (principalmente Hedge Funds y Market Makers) los inversores minoristas y los inversores institucionales con posiciones a largo plazo poseen actualmente aproximadamente 200%-400% del n\u00famero total de la flota de acciones, si no es que m\u00e1s, lo que significa que un 100%-300% de la flotaci\u00f3n tiene una posici\u00f3n corta correspondiente (en su mayor\u00eda corto al descubierto). Por contexto, la mayor\u00eda de las acciones generalmente tienen alrededor del 1% de inter\u00e9s corto, y el 10%-20% de inter\u00e9s corto se considera excesivo, y mucho menos m\u00e1s del 100%\n\nLos vendedores en corto deber\u00e1n eventualmente cerrar su posiciones y la \u00fanica forma de hacerlo es comprar las acciones propiedad de los inversores que son largos (mientras tanto, los vendedores en corto de las acciones sangran su capital al tener que pagar intereses sobre esa posici\u00f3n corta hasta que se cierre proporcionalmente al costo de las acciones.) Desafortunadamente para los vendedores en corto, los propietarios de las acciones **NO ESTAN** obligados a venderlas, en cambio los vendedores en corto, **SI ESTAN** obligados a comprar las acciones parar cerrar su posici\u00f3n corta (o seguir pagando intereses)\n\nEntonces \u00bfQu\u00e9 sucede si nadie vende las acciones de sus posiciones largas, pero los vendedores en corto necesitan comprarlas? La respuesta es oferta y demanda. Con muy poca oferta y alta demanda, el precio de una acci\u00f3n puede aumentar mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su valor fundamental. Si los vendedores en corto recibieron una llamada de margen debido a que ya no cumplen con su requisito de margen, sus activos ser\u00e1n liquidados a la fuerza por su prestamista para devolver el margen as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n cerrar la posici\u00f3n si el prestatario incumple.\n\nSi se pregunta porque una organizaci\u00f3n abusar\u00eda en comprar acciones en corto en una compa\u00f1\u00eda si eventualmente tienen que cubrir y cerrar su posici\u00f3n, la raz\u00f3n principal es, si la compa\u00f1\u00eda afectada llegara a caer en bancarrota o es removida de el mercado de valores, (Por ejemplo esto es lo que se cree que paso con \u00a8Toys R US) los participantes con posiciones cortas no tienen la obligaci\u00f3n de cerrar su posici\u00f3n ya que la posici\u00f3n simplemente desaparece del record y ni siquiera tienen que pagar impuestos en las ganancias que obtuvieron debido a esta jugada.\n\nLas posiciones cortas son el n\u00famero total de acciones menos la flota total significa (basados en el rango de esta teor\u00eda) que aproximadamente 56-170 millones de acciones van a tener que ser compradas para que los participantes en corto puedan cerrar sus posiciones, Se espera que estos participantes (Hedge Funds y Market Makers) no van a tener suficientes fondos para poder cerrar sus posiciones, resultando en que desde sus prestamistas hasta la c\u00e1mara de aprobaci\u00f3n DTCC ser\u00e1n responsables de lidiar con la posici\u00f3n corta. Si la DTCC es encargara de ello, se espera que ellos r\u00e1pidamente compraran las acciones a cualquier precio o amenos a si se ha dicho que funcionan sus sistemas cuando uno de los participantes llega a quebrar durante un evento como este.\n\n**En Resumen**\n\nGME tiene una cantidad de posiciones cortas abiertas que sobrepasa el n\u00famero total de acciones en el mercado, los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n principales reportan que este no es el caso, es muy importante recordar que los participantes que est\u00e1n m\u00e1s expuestos en este evento tambi\u00e9n poseen posiciones financieras muy grandes en estos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, b\u00e1sicamente forz\u00e1ndolos a entregar la narrativa al p\u00fablico que las posiciones cortas ya han sido cubiertas. Las ca\u00eddas de mercado y las del crypto durante Mayo se correlacionan con movimientos indicativos de una llamada de margen. GME no es la \u00fanica acci\u00f3n que posee una posici\u00f3n corta de esa magnitud, pero si es la que m\u00e1s ha afectado financieramente a los participantes en corto. Las posiciones cortas reducen el valor de una acci\u00f3n, si la acci\u00f3n llegara a caer en un valor de 0 (lo cual tambi\u00e9n afecta la posibilidad de poder obtener capital) la compa\u00f1\u00eda se va a la bancarrota, previniendo a los participantes de tener que cubrir por su posici\u00f3n corta. GME ha incrementado en precio en las \u00faltimas semanas lo cual causa p\u00e9rdidas diariamente para los participantes en corto, a medida que sube el precio, las perdidas contin\u00faan lo cual causa a los Hedge Funds a cubrir su posici\u00f3n antes de que sea demasiado tarde.\n\nEsto es la tesis del GME MOASS. GME es una acci\u00f3n que se prepara a llegar a un punto sin precedentes en el mercado debido a que los Hedge Funds y Market Makers no han podido llevar esta compa\u00f1\u00eda a la bancarrota, esto es gracias a [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen) y a todos los inversores minoristas que han formado parte de esta saga, talvez no sea hoy, estas semana o quiz\u00e1 este mes per un d\u00eda pronto estos participantes t\u00f3xicos no tendr\u00e1n ninguna otra opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s que comprar las acciones para cubr\u00ed su posici\u00f3n. Algo que tambi\u00e9n se debe tomar en cuenta es que estos mismos participantes subestimaron que tan razonables los inversores minoristas pueden ser, no vieron que el grupo democr\u00e1tico al que se enfrentaban. Los jugadores de video juegos son de las personas m\u00e1s aferradas del planeta, estos individuos se sumergen miles de horas en un video juego simplemente porque les gusta, bueno ahora han decidido que les gusta la acci\u00f3n GME y los villanos de este juego son los participantes t\u00f3xicos de Wall Street, talvez se toma m\u00e1s de un intento pero siempre se termina el juego con una victoria.\n\nEn este punto si est\u00e1s leyendo esto, depende de ti en decidir tu siguiente movimiento, ya sea hacer una investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda, ignorar el tema o decir que se joda y por si si o por si no, comprar un par de acciones en caso de que esta teor\u00eda sea correcta. Muchos de los inversores minoristas an establecido que el piso o sea lo m\u00ednimo en lo que vender\u00edan sus acciones, esta sobre los 20, 000,000 USD. No les importa si el resto del publico compra o no, porque saben que resultado final es inevitable. El tiempo se acaba para los participantes t\u00f3xicos involucrados, e incluso los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n principales ya no pueden esconder que estamos al borde de un evento de mercado masivo que mandara olas a trav\u00e9s del sistema financiero global y probablemente nunca volveremos a presenciar un evento como est\u00e9 en nuestras vidas.\n\n**Un poco de historia**\n\nSer\u00eda una falta de respeto no darle espacio en este documento a un hombre llamado Keith Gill tambi\u00e9n conocido como u/DeepFuckingValue en reddit y [TheRoaringKitty](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty) en twitter. Si no sabe a qui\u00e9n me refiero, lo puede investigar por medio del internet, este hombre quien se convirti\u00f3 en nada corto que en una leyenda, quien demostr\u00f3 desde un principio lo que significa tener Diamond Hands (manos de diamante) y sin el, GME no se encontrar\u00eda donde se encuentra hoy. A mediados del a\u00f1o 2020, la comunidad en l\u00ednea de reddit r/Wallstreetbets descubri\u00f3 que tantas posiciones cortas hab\u00eda en GME, y para Diciembre era cre\u00eddo por muchos que un evento de Short Squeeze se aproximaba. Diciembre 2020 se convirti\u00f3 en Enero 2021, mientras tanto los miembros de la comunidad compraban todo lo que alcanzaban con su dinero, muchos de ellos empezando cuando la acci\u00f3n ten\u00eda un valor de un solo digito. A medida que el valor de la acci\u00f3n sub\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente durante Enero, teniendo un gran impacto en la situaci\u00f3n financiera de los participantes t\u00f3xicos, se llev\u00f3 a cabo la primera Squeeze de GME, con millones de inversores minoristas brincando movimiento, llevando el precio de la acci\u00f3n a una record de $500 USD por acci\u00f3n. Desafortunadamente la Squeeze fue detenida ya que muchos de los populares corredores de bolsa interactivos, como Robinhood bloquearan completamente la habilidad de comprar GME, permitiendo a sus clientes solo el poder vender sus acciones o en muchos casos cerrando las posiciones sin ninguna autorizaci\u00f3n para protegerse a ellos mismos y a los Hedge Funds y Market Makers a los que ellos responden. Despu\u00e9s de que los inversores minoristas no pudieran comprar m\u00e1s acciones, el precio callo a las $40 USD antes de estabilizarse, cost\u00e1ndoles billones de d\u00f3lares en p\u00e9rdidas a los participantes t\u00f3xicos.\n\nA pesar de la ca\u00edda a los $40 USD, hab\u00eda muchos indicadores apuntando a que la gran mayor\u00eda de las acciones compradas antes del Squeeze en Enero, a\u00fan no hab\u00edan sido vendidas, apoyando la posibilidad de que todav\u00eda exist\u00eda una cantidad masiva de posiciones cortas en GME pero muchos se rindieron, perdiendo grandes cantidades de dinero en esta jugada. Con nada m\u00e1s que esperanza o simplemente por no querer vender en perdida, una gran cantidad de inversores minoristas sostuvieron sus acciones, muchos de los cuales hab\u00edan pagado desde $100 USD a $400 USD por acci\u00f3n y que hab\u00edan visto el valor sus carteras caer desde un 50% a un 90% o m\u00e1s. Estos inversores sostuvieron a como es referido en la comunidad ser diamond hands, y de la nada, el 24/02/2021 el precio de cuadruplico de $40 USD a $169.56 USD de un d\u00eda para otro, fue en ese d\u00eda que la esperanza fue renovada para los inversores de GME y era m\u00e1s cierto que la saga aun no hab\u00eda concluido. Otras comunidades de Reddit, como r/superstonk, continuaron donde r/wallstreetbets lo hab\u00eda dejado, haciendo investigaciones sobre cada \u00e1ngulo de GME, encantando a los profesionales y las autoridades del mundo financiero y recibiendo su opini\u00f3n, sabidur\u00eda y apoyo. Esta comunidad de inversores ha aprendido m\u00e1s sobre el mercado de los que muchos otros han aprendido o incluso de los que muchos aprender\u00e1n en toda su vida a invertir.\n\nDurante esta etapa de aprendizaje, se ha hecho cierto para los inversores que el mercado de valores siempre estuvo saboteado en contra de ellos, los responsables son los Hedge Funds y Market Makers involucrados en Wall Street quienes han encontrado maneras de abusar el sistema y tomar ventaja de la supervisi\u00f3n regulatoria limitada para su ganancia propia a costo de grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas e inversores minoristas por igual.\n\nDesafortunadamente para esos grupos de Wall Street, estos inversores saben que el tiempo se acaba, y es imposible para los participantes t\u00f3xicos escapar de sus posiciones. Otro hecho notable es que para varios de estos inversores minoristas no se trata sobre el dinero. Gracias a las investigaciones altamente inteligentes de esta comunidad, que prefieren el apodo de simios (Apes) pero que tambi\u00e9n son referidos como dinero tonto en Wall Street, esta comunidad sabe exactamente que partidos est\u00e1n contaminando el mercado y quien puede llegar a perder m\u00e1s en este evento. Muchos sostendr\u00e1n sus acciones hasta que todos los participantes t\u00f3xicos caigan en bancarrota. A los inversores minoristas no les cuesta nada sostener su posici\u00f3n y no tienen ning\u00fan intenci\u00f3n de venderla hasta que vean un numero grande, y no me refiero a un n\u00famero grande para ellos si no un numero grande para las organizaciones corruptas.\n\nTL;DR: Esta es unas batallas entre la clase elite y el trabajador com\u00fan de la sociedad. Condiciones en juego (como la habilidad de manipular el mercado bruscamente con grandes cantidades de dinero) han apoyado que un evento como este tome direcci\u00f3n en lo que pudiera ser la trasferencia de riqueza m\u00e1s grande en la historia, las normas que han sido aprobadas a lo largo de este evento previenen que algo como esto vuelva a poder ocurrir de nuevo.\n\nSi encuentra algun error o tema mal explicado, estoy mas que disponible a recibir critica constructiva para asi mejorar este articulo que ya es desde hace tiempo un tema con mucha atencion alreadedor del mundo.", "source": "reddit", "author": "towers97"}, {"content": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Haim Bodek - The Wall Street Code | VPRO documentary | 2013](https://reddit.com/link/o1ko1g/video/snpffqdr0q571/player)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any new apes that haven't watched this documentary, I would *highly* recommend watching it.

These guys are basically the Netherlands' version of the SEC. The whole report is super interesting, but I'm only going to cover the highlights that are relevant to this particular discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The report covers GameStop trading activity by private Dutch investors (aka retail) during the period of January 18 2021 - March 18 2021.\n* During this timeframe, 29,394 investors traded GME, none of whom had invested in GME before (*though if someone wants to confirm this translation, it\u2019s just under figure 1 -* Edit: Translation confirmed)\n* The average total purchased value within this group of investors was $11,532.\n* The average purchase price within this group of investors was $189 per share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let's start with that. $11,532 / $189 = 61.015873 shares on average, multiplied by 29,394 investors = 1,793,501 shares purchased in the Netherlands between January 18 and March 18. A note here: this is a cumulative number, so if someone bought 10 shares, sold them all, bought 10 more, sold them all, then bought 10 more again, it would be represented here as 30 shares, not as 10 shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat, that's cool, but... so what? Well, if we know what portion of shares were held in the Netherlands at that time, then we can establish how many shares there were worldwide. Let's take a look at what the Bloomberg terminal has to say about share distribution across different geographic locations around this timeframe (huge thank you to u/ravada for providing these screenshots!) - the Bloomberg terminal doesn't allow specifically selecting a mid-week date, so we'll see what the data shows for the beginning of the week of March 18th (a Thursday) as well as after that week ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Link](https://prnt.sc/15fk0qd) for first screenshot, if you want it\n\n[Screenshot from a Bloomberg terminal where we can see geographic ownership on March 14 2021, the beginning of the week in question](https://preview.redd.it/o3vuufo7rf571.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c544b6332ca97983bcc994f8bd511bcc4ac558)\n\n[Link](https://prnt.sc/15fk1l2) for second screenshot, if you want it\n\n[Screenshot from a Bloomberg terminal where we can see geographic ownership on March 21 2021, the end of the week in question - note that there is no difference for the Netherlands when comparing these two data points.](https://preview.redd.it/zlm28delrf571.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b39bacf0ed55d943b6f50789b4873bd167ba0af)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we can see from the Bloomberg terminal that the shares held in the Netherlands made up only 0.19% of the worldwide GME share ownership at that time.\n\nBut wait! Maybe some of the Dutch apes who are discussed in the report sold their shares! Yes, that's a good point. You may have seen the many posts with screenshots from Fidelity, showing that on any given day, [Fidelity](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nx8d77/stonk_goes_down_82_27_and_fidelity_apes_like_all/) users generally have approximately a 75%-80% buy ratio, with only about 20%-25% of orders being sell orders. Similarly, there have been screenshots of [eToro](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6y85s/100_of_etoro_traders_are_buying/) and [Webull](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzhv7b/bullish_af/) showing 100% buy ratios on the day of those screenshots. Obviously, these are just point-in-time references and don\u2019t necessarily reflect the average buying trends of those brokers, but it gives us an idea of where to start. Interestingly, the report also mentions that for some Dutch broker, GME was the most traded stock in February and March - this matches up with a lot of those screenshots we saw about GameStop being the most popular stock in most European countries around that time. But... wait... the aborted squeeze (when many brokers shut off the ability to buy GME) happened in January... so GME was the most traded stock AFTER the aborted squeeze had already happened, so the people buying up GME at that point were probably a whole lot of HODLer apes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we'll take a look at 5 scenarios:\n\n* a very conservative option where only 30% of those shares were held, while the rest were sold (or possibly bought &amp; sold repeatedly, like in my example at the beginning)\n* a conservative option where 50% of shares held\n* a cautious but realistic option (based on the Fidelity / Webull / eToro screenshots) where 70% of shares were held\n* a cautiously optimistic option where 80% of shares were held\n* a very optimistic option where 90% of shares were held\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Even if we're being really conservative, there are way too fucking many shares](https://preview.redd.it/1o1e1fycsf571.png?width=530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4e6e9ee0472992b1a15e58bb8b49510ae0d1a5)\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure someone with more wrinkles than me can take this info and come up with a model to show how share ownership may have increased (I assume) over time as more and more naked shorts were dumped into the market and apes gobbled them up. Remember that the estimates I laid out above were for share count up to March 18th, which was after u/deepfuckingvalue initially doubled down from 50K to 100K shares (Feb 19), but before his final call options expired and he posted that update showing us that he had doubled down again to 200K shares (Apr 16). How many other people have potentially doubled their positions in the last 3 months? Also missing from this data are the shares that Dutch retail investors may have already been holding prior to January 18th, and any shares that may have been held by Dutch financial institutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The TLDR is the infographic at the top.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: There is some contention around the accuracy of the location data in Bloomberg, and whether or not it can be used in this context. My understanding was that the location info is based on brokers (and that the unknown segment is largely driven by brokers who service multiple countries) but there is some discussion in the comments about this breakdown possibly being specific to institutional holdings. Can't seem to find a solid source one way or the other, if you have one please add it to the comments! In the meantime, take this calculation with a grain of salt in case the geographic breakdown is not applicable to this dataset.", "source": "reddit", "author": "catsinbranches"}, {"content": "Hello to all my fellow crayon consumers. I've gone on so many rants about GameStop and the economy overall lately that pretty much everyone I know IRL is understandably tired of hearing about it. Still, I'm fixated on this and can't focus on anything else, so I tried writing a bit to let off some of the steam. I have a website I post my writing on but no one really reads it, I just have it so I have my own little space to say what I want I guess. I'm not really sure who to share it with besides you guys, but I tried to write this in a way where even people who have never been to SuperStonk can understand what's going on with GME and also the inflation going on in the economy overall. Any feedback is much appreciated. Please put a banana in my ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: We're about to get bent over and fucked by inflation. I don't mean we as in SuperStonk, I mean we as in every single person in America.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote my first piece about GameStop on January 30th. It hasn\u2019t even been six months since then, but January 30th feels like a lifetime ago after everything that has happened since. Shortly after that in early February as GameStop slid back below $50 a share, I deleted my previous article out of shame and picked up a retail job so I could earn back the money I had lost so foolishly. Ironically, by the time I was able to start that job, GameStop stock was once again on a meteoric rise into the hundreds of dollars. My goal shifted from earning back the money I had \"lost\" (I was actually starting to see some profit at this point) to using my paychecks to accumulate as many shares as I could while still having enough left over to cover expenses and a bit of saving. I\u2019ve kept that strategy going ever since, and my position in GME has continued to grow as short sellers continue to \u201ckick the can down the road\u201d instead of covering their shorts. Once I had learned enough to regain my self-confidence, I restored my old GameStop article and added to it to explain some of what I had discovered. At least two months have passed since then, and the situation in the stock market has only gotten more volatile. I\u2019m not qualified to offer financial advice and I certainly won\u2019t be giving any, but I will say that I\u2019m incredibly happy with my investment in GME and would recommend looking into the company for anyone aiming to invest in a stock with high potential for growth.\n\nI also highly recommend the community that has formed among investors in GME stock, namely the subreddit r/SuperStonk (with an honorable mention for r/DDintoGME, r/GME, and r/DeepFuckingValue). Much like r/GME became a refuge for GameStop investors after r/WallStreetBets began to censor and remove all content related to GME, r/SuperStonk became a safe haven for those same investors after r/GME showed similar signs of being compromised a few weeks later. The move from the ten million strong WSB community to r/GME left us with roughly 200,000 users, but the migration from r/GME to r/SuperStonk kept pretty much everyone. SuperStonk has continued to grow as more people become curious about GameStop, and the sub now has almost half a million members. The sub has also endured countless attempts at fearmongering, forum splitting, and other forms of online sabotage, and it appears to be strong enough to see this GameStop saga through to its epic conclusion. The sub isn\u2019t just incredibly durable; SuperStonk is also extremely positive and welcoming to all Redditors. While subs like r/Conservative or r/Liberal tend to seek out like-minded members and exclude/ridicule those who disagree, r/SuperStonk is built on a foundation of being nice to one another always and promoting evidence-based academic discussion alongside a healthy serving of memes and shitposts. It\u2019s somewhere you can have fun and make friends while still learning some of the most valuable information you may ever come across in your life.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the potential for getting filthy rich that makes this information so valuable. Being a member of r/SuperStonk has taught me more about economics and the stock market in a few short months than I ever learned taking AP Macroeconomics in high school (AP Econ did teach me foundational concepts that were incredibly helpful for understanding the GME situation, so this isn\u2019t me saying not to take AP Econ \u2013 quite the opposite actually). Do you know what VWAP, OBV, and MACD are? What\u2019s the significance of seeing larger swings in share price occurring on lower and lower volume? What\u2019s a reverse repo agreement, and why is the Federal Reserve issuing more of them than ever before? Six months ago, this all would have been gibberish to me, so if it looks like gibberish to you now, don\u2019t worry. Users from all corners of SuperStonk have made a plethora of posts explaining everything from OBV to reverse repo, and they\u2019re all available for free to anyone who wants to learn more. It\u2019s going to take hours and hours of reading to understand all of this, but it\u2019s completely worth it. Jump in.\n\nWhy? To get rich enough to never work again just from buying a \u201csilly meme stock\u201d? Well yeah, that\u2019s the most enticing part of this whole deal, but it\u2019s not the most important part. The real goal for everyone who wants to get involved should be to have a better understanding of our economy and the way that monetary policy affects us as individuals. This knowledge will be crucial for success long after the GME MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) is only a distant memory, and knowing more about how money functions will help us create a future economy that lets all people directly and proportionally benefit from the fruits of their labor. Our current economy \u2013 one that functions mostly on exploitation and the hoarding of wealth \u2013 is unsustainable and will need to be replaced if humanity wants to be able to tackle our most pressing crises (like climate collapse) on a global scale.\n\nAt the risk of sounding too much like a conspiracy theorist, this is not what the wealthy, the government, or the media want to happen. All three of those groups are positioned very comfortably in our current economic hierarchy and do not want to see significant change. The wealthy want to get richer and increase the distance between themselves and the working class. The media is owned by those same wealthy individuals, and media companies make far more money reporting on the widespread injustices that plague our system than they could ever make trying to solve those issues. Our government officials (and I do mean both parties here) tend to be wealthy themselves and rely on donations from rich supporters to fund their political campaigns. We know the wealthy aren\u2019t going to try and make things more equal for us poor people, and the government and the media don\u2019t have our best interests at heart either. It\u2019s up to us to look out for ourselves.\n\nLooking out for my own financial best interest is what led me to invest in GameStop in the first place. As a result, I was very confused when I saw the first news article beginning with \u201cForget GameStop\u201d pop up on my feed at the start of February. All of the personal research I had done made me feel sure that GameStop was a solid investment, so I was buying more and more shares even as the price fell. Meanwhile MarketWatch, the Motley Fool, CNBC, and countless others were bombarding me with articles urging me to sell and forget GameStop entirely. First of all, that\u2019s dumb as hell because how am I going to forget GameStop when you keep writing articles about it every week? Sus. It might have worked a bit in early February, but by the time we hit the third week of \u201cForget GameStop\u201d headlines every article just further confirmed my bias that I was right to pick this stock. Second of all, these outlets market themselves as the place where retail investors should go to seek out the best financial advice. Online forums like Reddit are supposed to be untrustworthy compared to the professionals over at MarketWatch and CNBC. If that were true, CNBC should have been begging me to YOLO my entire savings account on GME shares at $40, but they didn\u2019t. That would have been great financial advice given that GameStop\u2019s share price hasn\u2019t fallen below $100 since February (can Apple give me 100%+ gains in a month? No? Lame), but CNBC was urging me to sell what I had and avoid buying more. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that this is objectively terrible financial advice. That would have been the worst possible action I could have taken financially at the time. So why would CNBC risk their reputation as a reputable source of financial advice just to spread disinformation on some \u201cirrelevant\u201d meme stock?\n\nWell, CNBC is owned and run by a bunch of wealthy people, the kind who would lose a lot of money if the hedge funds they invest with suddenly went bankrupt after being forced to close out millions of naked shorts. Money flying out of their pockets and into the hands of the poors is a rich man\u2019s worst nightmare, and CNBC\u2019s first and foremost responsibility is to keep its owners and investors happy. When you look at the situation from this angle, it\u2019s no surprise that CNBC chose to paint GameStop and GME investors in the worst possible light rather than informing the public of the truth \u2013 that greedy hedge funds had been abusively naked shorting dozens of stocks, and in doing so they opened up a black hole in the stock market that has the potential to function like an infinite money glitch in a video game. Telling people the truth would have had CNBC giving out the best financial advice of the century, but CNBC isn\u2019t actually about giving retail investors solid financial advice. It\u2019s about encouraging retail investors to put their money where it\u2019s going to be most convenient for the wealthy to play with and gain from before retail is ultimately left holding the bag, as always.\n\nMonths of hearing \u201cForget GameStop\u201d every week while I knew that I was right taught me to question everything I hear from the media and government officials about the economy, so when Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen, and others told Americans that the inflation we\u2019re currently experiencing is \u201ctransitory\u201d, something didn\u2019t feel right. Luckily many of my fellow SuperStonk users shared that same feeling, and ultimately we found some answers. Unfortunately, if I tried to fully explain the situation here, this would be less of an article and more of a novel. Seriously, u/atobitt\u2019s House of Cards I, II, and III are 32 pages long when you put them all together, and that\u2019s without including other important pieces of his research like The Everything Short and Citadel Has No Clothes. All of that research came from a single user, and there are dozens if not hundreds of users contributing high quality research to the sub and revising in real time it as it\u2019s peer reviewed. When I say that learning through SuperStonk involves a lot of reading, I mean it, but here\u2019s why it\u2019s worth your time even if you couldn\u2019t give a single fuck about GameStop. Consider this the abridged version.\n\nInflation is about to get bad. Like really, really bad. Unlike wild swings in the price of GME, which only affect those who have taken a long or short position in that particular stock, inflation affects every single participant in the economy. That includes me, and it includes you. When I bought my shares of GME, I signed on to take the risk that my shares could go up or down in value and that I would have little to no control over the price. I entered that agreement voluntarily. Not one single person in America would volunteer to have the value in their paychecks and savings accounts sucked away through inflation, but it\u2019s going to happen to every single one of us anyway whether we like it or not. We don\u2019t exactly get a choice in the matter; if you want to live in America (or like me, you were just kinda *born here*), you have to use the US dollar and participate in the American economy. You pay your rent/mortgage with dollars. You buy your food with dollars. You keep your savings in dollars. The United States government is in charge of maintaining the dollar and guiding our economy in the right direction. One of the ways they do this is by printing more money as the economy expands. This ensures that there will be enough dollars to go around as our population continues to increase. This also lowers the value of the dollar overall because there are now more dollars in existence. This is part of why we\u2019ve seen home prices rise from thousands of dollars in the 1950\u2019s to hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not millions) today. There were less dollars circulating in the 1950 economy, so it took less dollars to make up the value of a single home. With how many dollars are circulating in the economy today, it takes hundreds of thousands of them to equal the value of a single home. The state of the housing market can cause short-term fluctuations in price, but in the grand scheme of the economy inflation is the main reason why the price of a home has risen so astronomically in our lifetimes.\n\nInflation is a necessary evil of economics. Printing money siphons value away from the savings of people who already have that currency, but without printing more money there simply wouldn\u2019t be enough dollars to go around as the population increased. Having some level of inflation in your currency is generally unavoidable, so the goal of any government\u2019s monetary policy isn\u2019t so much to prevent inflation as it is to keep inflation as a desirable level. For the United States, this means inflation of about 1-2% per year. We\u2019re currently at 4.2%, and that\u2019s with the government trying to paint the rosiest possible picture of our faltering economy. Inflation is particularly harmful when wages aren\u2019t rising to match the increasing cost of living, so given that increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr got shot down hard earlier this year even though we haven\u2019t raised the minimum wage since 2009, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in trouble.\n\nWith inflation on the rise, you\u2019d think we would want to stop printing more money, right? Well, we\u2019ve done the opposite. The US government has had to spend unprecedented amounts of money to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it will have to spend even more if we want to revamp our healthcare system or restore our crumbling infrastructure. In most countries, the government would raise taxes on the wealthiest people and sectors of the economy to raise the funds needed for such aggressive spending. Since we don\u2019t tax rich people in America, our economic policymakers chose instead to turn the money printer on at maximum speed and let it run indefinitely. What\u2019s the worst that could happen, right? Much of the money that had been printed was quickly funneled into the stock market, reversing the crash of March 2020 and propelling the market to new heights. This helped create a narrative that the economy was recovering and kept consumers from experiencing immediate increases in the prices of their goods and services. That much money entering the economy can\u2019t be hidden for long though, so consumers started to notice prices slowly increasing even though the stock market was telling us that most companies were rolling in cash. Now we\u2019re at a point where it costs $5 just for a stick of deodorant. I wish I could say the prices we\u2019re seeing now are as bad as things will get, but in truth this is only beginning. The massive bubble created from pumping billions into the stock market has yet to pop, and when it does \u2026 things will get ugly. The 2008 crisis will feel like a warmup. Shit will hit the fan and spray everywhere.\n\nFor me, this adventure started with throwing $50 at a meme stock on a whim, and it\u2019s looking like it might end in hyperinflation and economic collapse. Being right about GME/the overall market would mean I\u2019m about to become a multimillionaire, but it would also mean that we\u2019re about to get absolutely destroyed by hyperinflation. Even if my newfound wealth would protect me from the fallout, I don\u2019t want to see more families losing their jobs and homes just because Wall Street can\u2019t stop playing illegal games in the stock market and the government is soft enough to bail them out each time. I\u2019ve been convinced that I\u2019m right about GameStop and the market since January, and I\u2019m still convinced that I\u2019m right. The only difference now is that I really, really wish I was wrong.", "source": "reddit", "author": "Notorious_UNA"}, {"content": "What's up Apes?\n\nWhat a wild ride it has been, and to commemorate this roller coaster I present to you the Hall of Fame of Hype.

No particular reason that I knew of. It is just that I don't really trust people. But I have realized that it is time to come out and show the world who I am. And also myself because that is a big part of this.\n\nSo before I get into everything I have to put some things out first. I think I play a bigger part in this whole GME saga than I myself ever realized or wanted. I didn't want any of this but I know understand it had to happen. Not myself nor anybody else could stop me. Even though it didn't even know I was doing something until last week.\n\nSome may remember the user u/Not_a_deutscher which is me and I wrote among other things [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20210327183349if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mebxbb/listen_up_apes_this_could_be_the_most_important/) post. I realized that a lot of my posts got saved on the Waybackmachine. Even some that got pretty much no upvotes at all. That felt strange at the time of discovery. \n\nThe thing that made me understand that I had to write something was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxe8qd/i_believe_free_markets_cannot_be_free_unless_they/) post by u/StonkU2. \n\nThis year has been an absolute rollercoaster for me and the events that happened throughout the last months are so strange that it almost took my sanity. For those that were waiting for this exact post all this time, I am deeply sorry it took so long. But I had to rule out every single other possibility first. Because what I am about to fill you in is the opposite of everything I ever wanted in my life. But that makes it all the more fitting.\n\nSo let's get started. I am just gonna write this along as I always do. No notes or anything but I think if you want GameStop to succeed you should take the time to read this.\n\nAfter some of my posts with u/Not_a_Deutscher I got invited into a DD chat here on reddit. With among about 80 other users people like u/rensole u/atobitt and also u/DeepFuckingValue. Of those names that anyone knows of, many like DFV or atobitt never wrote anything. And neither did I. Until the great migration to r/Superstonk started and chaos broke out. For the next couple of days I started to chat more and more with those guys because it was interesting to figure out what exactly was going on. I had no clue at the time as I was very new to the stock market but it felt nice to talk to some people that seemed to know more than I did. Because GME was my first real investment. And the first time a really looked at the stock market. Because money was always the last thing I cared about.\n\nBut something felt off and weird things started to happen to me in real life after I started writing in this group. My life became an actual movie and I was the protagonist. I felt so stressed out and after I felt pretty sure that [the Roaring Kitty](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty) tweets were a direct reaction to what I wrote in this chat I kind of collapsed mentally. I needed time off. I felt like I was turning insane and that scarred me. But I always looked at myself as a highly rational person. I never rule something out completely until I am sure of it.\n\nSo I took a step back. Spent some time with my friends and in nature. Took some walks tried to bring my life back in order. All while I was still working and had shit to do.\n\nI live on my own. Like a normal person I buy groceries, cook my own meals and scrub my own toilette clean. This may seem weird right now to mention but it will make more sense soon.\n\nSo now let me tell you a bit about myself.\n\nI was born and raised in Germany and I grew up in a small town called Gaildorf. As of writing this I am 27 years old. I was a weird kid. I wanted to know everything and I also used to try out everything. Grown ups couldn't handle me. No one could except for my mother.\n\n[Here is a picture of me as a Kid my aunt made.](https://preview.redd.it/dqcetda0b8571.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b439968800a63554249fb50b8b041eb7cba9f3e4)\n\nAfter I left elementary school I was diagnosed with ADD and also an exceptional high IQ at the time. I never told anyone because I think people that have to throw this number around after making a 15 minute IQ test always feel of themselves as smarter than they actually are and it instantly makes them look a bit dumb to me. My test took 2 weeks with about an hour each day and at age 10 I was told to have an IQ of 136.\n\nAnd then I got fed pills for the next 8 years. Strong pills. Concerta with 48mg. I became more and more depressed and I hated everything about life. It seemed like nobody liked me and everything the world cared about is how to accumulate wealth.   \nI had friends but I didn't really like most of them. But what I always liked was gaming. I loved it. I still remember the very first time I played Pok\u00e9mon on the GameBoy and it gave me so much joy. For the longest time the only thing I wanted was a GameBoy. And I liked to play with anyone that had any kind of gaming console. And not only did I like games, I also liked gamers. They were a different kind of people. Everyone told me gamers are do nothing weirdos that only waste their life away.   \nEvery single person that was older and \"wiser\" than me told me how there is no future in gaming and computers. Especially my father who hated everything about computers. He always wanted to be the best at everything but could never figure out those machines.  \nAll I ever really wanted was a Pikachu.   \nBut as I left elementary school and right when I started to take the pills I got my very first GameBoy. A clear ocean blue GameBoy Advance. It was my everything and I took it wherever we went. Pokemon became my safe haven. I did not care about anything the grown ups were talking about because the only thing they were talking about was themselves and money. And I was also told to care about money because in Germany we say \"Haste was, biste was. Haste nix, bist auch nix.\" If you have something you are someone. If have have nothing you are nothing.  \nWhat a load of bullshit. I ventured through life on my own. Always trying to listen to my mother who cared a lot for me but also doing the things I liked.\n\nThe relationship with my father got worse and worse. He used to scream at each other a lot and he lost himself more and more. Listening to all the liars around him. Thinking he was the greatest even though I always saw the little hurt child in him. I always saw people for what they were. Still do. The older I got the better I got at reading people. And I can now safely say, money corrupts the soul.\n\nAnd this brings me into the juicy stuff. I am a born evangelical christian. I got baptized and had my confirmation at 14. That was when my grandmother gave me a present. She inherited a lot of money from her dead husband that she remarried after the left my grandfather, the father of my father. But at this time she was about to become broke because she wasted all of her money on party and glamour but she did not want to show up with nothing so she gave me a golden watch. I liked the watch. Still do. Even though I don't care about it from a money value standpoint but more about the fact that she gave me something off value when she herself was about to become broke. Because she never really gave me anything before. Not her time or anything else. It felt like the first selfless thing she ever did for me. I don't know why but I lately started to feel like this watch is important which is why I am gonna show you some pictures. If I am right, the right people will know and understand. I myself have no idea though. Maybe it is nothing but I just have to include it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wehn9ejsf8571.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a96487dfc8c491de76498ce15a71cffecc10103\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8bwxjnbtf8571.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45d6c978bb80dd473c9f19b867aaea53642718c\n\nMy parents are believers in god. But it never resonated with me. How could there be a god if I felt so sad all the time. Everyone thought of myself as a rich kid that has no worries in the world because my parents own a company. But what good does money do if you can't do what you want even if you hurt nobody else.\n\nSo I walked through life. Kept going on. Cried a lot. Felt sad and alone a lot. We didn't have internet at home for the longest time and when we got it I was rarely allowed to use it and if so only for school related stuff. So I watched many movies, loved the Simpsons and played a ton of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nBut things changed a little bit in 2007 when I got a 1. gen iPod Touch for Christmas. I was never allowed a cellphone until I was 15. But this iPod was my very first step to getting onto the internet on myself. We did not have W-LAN at home so got into the next multimedia market and bought myself a router and set it up. I did not no the importance of this back then. I found the Internet for myself and my life started getting better. Back then I really liked [The Amazing Atheist](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAmazingAtheist). He was the first that spoke my mind about religion and gave me another perspective. \n\nThis was also the time when music really entered my life. Oh what would I be today without music. Nothing is the answer. But I never liked the flashy \"feel good\" music on the radio. It was fake and scripted. I soon discoved Rock and dove a little bit into metal. I also listened to a lot of Rap Music. I liked [Bushido](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5fqBVISmU) at the time. Even though I knew he was an asshole I saw his talent and how he was just like me. A hurt kid that tried to stand up for himself. And I also liked his name because it means \"Way of the warrior.\" And I felt that.\n\nBands like Linkin Park, Green Day, Rise Against, Sum41, Rammstein, Simple Plan any many more became my Mantra. But I also liked soft music like [Rosenstolz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1aSGRd0hg0) and as a Kid is loved [Adiemus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQP7m9VNpO8).\n\nEverything that had a soul because the world around me had none.\n\nI left spirituality and faith behind me because the world I was living in was left of it. I kept going on. As my mother told me. Because she was the only person I at least felt loved by. Went through \"Gymnasium\" which in Germany is the \"hardest\" school you can go to after Elementary school. But \"hard\" is a very loose description of it. It is longer and a bit more challenging but not something you need in any way to really succeed.\n\nI started to study economics on 2 different universities but the first time I ended it myself and the second time I got ended by someone else. So I was standing there around Christmas with nothing. I was older and more mature at the time and started to get along better with my father. He asked me if I wanted to work in his company. A small concrete pipe factory. I didn't really care about any work I could do around my home and I felt like something that could bring my father and me back together. Which is something I wanted. Even though he was always difficult and I hated him at certain times, I never wanted to hate him. I cared about the relationship with my father. It was only the person that he became that I didn't like.\n\nSo the first 3 years I worked there I learned a lot if things. Did a lot of things. And understood a lot of things that are wrong with this company. And I also understood why so much was going wrong. He never cared about his workers. Only about their work. He told them what to do and left. And if they didn't do good, it was their fault. Not his. Because in his mind everyone around him was stupid. Not his instruction that were more than questionable. \n\nIt would be a lie if I told you that everything he did was wrong. He knew a lot about mechanics and had a deep understanding about moving parts. But he never saw the people behind the machines. Only people behaving like machines. \n\nAfter 3 years of working there I stared a so called \"Duales Studium\" in engineering and economics which in Germany combines studying and working at the same time. You are in blocks of 3 to 6 months either at the company or university and you get paid fulltime by your company. \n\nI met a lot of people there and for the first time my life started to improve. It was hard and I was still depressed a lot but I met people there that are real. A good friend of mine which can draw exceptionally well once made a drawing of me during class. I just have to include this because it felt like the first time someone really saw me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnebmu0rm8571.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c0ac726ca60bdf8dfb8cbc7def47dfb72bae10\n\nShe made this. And this is how I felt all the time. Like a hurt little creature that just wants to be free and do what he wants but it was like the whole world is against me. Oh what did I know back then.\n\nAnother good friend introduced me to Smash Ultimate. Which is funny because it was my game even though I never played it. We were always sitting around and learning in a group. It was fun. First time in a while when learning felt like fun again. And after every some hours we learned we played some games of Mario Kart. Until we had enough and this friend really wanted to play Smash. \n\nI bought the game because I loved Smash as a kid on the N64 and I always loved Nintendo. So I bought Smash Ultimate, unlocked all the characters and then never picked it up again until this day. We always played triple threat. Me and my two friends. And slowly got into the game. Started to learn it and started to bond over it together. Just like in the old times as a kid when I played a lot of Co-Op with my friends.\n\nDuring this time Corona hit. And was never really able to see my friends again except for Skype. We met up one last time and it was a joy. University ended. I met a lot of people, learned a lot about life. Glad I did the engineering part because it brought back my love for math. Played a ton of Hearthstone at the time. Even got to Rank 3 on the EU server once with my Aggro Paladin but then fucked it up when I tried to get to number 1 while being drunk.\n\nI brought my new found love for Smash back home. Introduced it to 2 of my good friends there. One was instantly hooked, the other one I had the fed it. He also always wanted to be the best at everything. When he did not get it right early on he got frustrated and didn't want to play anymore. But I knew how to get him. I let him win a couple of times without him knowing. That was enough to keep him going. And he also started to learn and love the game. Playing this game together made us better friends then we ever were. We talked about Characters, moves and gameplay. We could see another persons true character in the way they were playing. If you want to find out who someone really is, watch him play a game and you will find out.\n\nTogether with smash we became really close friends and a wholesome trio. I always liked those guys even though I knew they had issues with themselves. Both had a hard childhood with overwhelmed parents. We used to drink and party a lot before covid. That was now impossible but we still wanted to hang out together so we took late night walks and drove around with bikes and stuff. 3 Grown up men hanging out together having fun. Nothing sexual going on and I still dearly love these guys.\n\nWe lost that.\n\nMen lost that. \"What are you hanging around with those guys all the time, are you gay or what?\"  \nWhat the fuck..? Even if I was, why has everything to be about sex. I love sex. The kinky stuff and a lot of the shit nobody talks about. You like to get pegged? Good for you. Go at it tiger. I mean I like it and whose business is it anyway.  \nWe live in a world of fear. But not fear of others but fear of ourselves. Fear of being who we truly are because how could anyone love our true selves. But what so many people fail to understand is that this is the only love there is. If someone doesn't love you for who you are, who does he love then. Is it you or is it the image you created of you and how could anybody ever be happy with being an image.\n\nWe evolve. We change. What used to be our honest truth today could become the lie of tomorrow. As long as we keep learning we keep evolving. But if we cling to a lie we can never be free. That is just how that works.\n\nI found my love again. My love for people. Through gaming. Games are one of the most important things in existence and instead of playing games and living live we started to play with lives and life the game. Everything got inverted. The whole world did and it almost broke because of it.\n\nBut that is not all that I found lately. I found the spirits again. I was a Nihilist but the world kept screaming at me to wake up, look and listen. I am sorry that it took me so long to finally understand this. But I had to go through all those hardships to really understand what I have to do.\n\nI moved in into the house of my grandfather. It is a small house directly at the forrest. It is small and this is great because it has everything you need. It is wonderful. I still belongs to my father and I pay rent but that is ok. Living here made me whole again. Animals started to come back into my life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it13qpmqq8571.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88844360af5dac38be472275b318b0514aab1bdf\n\nDeers started to show up directly in front of me. And I know it may sound strange to many of you but I felt those deers. I started to feel everything. Even the trees. Whenever shit got really out of hand in my real life lately I found peace in the forrest. It made me calm again. Made my find my inner peace. And this peace is real. And I am the very last person that I ever thought of saying this. I started to eat more healthy. Completely stopped drinking alcohol except for very special occasions. \n\nI realized how everything in the world is connected. Every life you take, every tree you cut down, every river you poison will come back to you. It is not by anyones intention but by the world itself. The world is whole and if you try to disrupt it it will make itself whole again. The truth always prevails. Nothing you could ever do about it.\n\nAround 2016 I broke up with my then long time girlfriend. I haven't seen her in years and I really should reach out to her some day because I did her a lot of wrong. She knew many things I didn't back then. I always treated her with respect but I made some mistakes I only later realized. I am deeply sorry for that.  \nBut it brought me back to Metal Music. She always loved it and I thought listening to it was feeding on her depression. I could not have been more wrong. That is pretty much the greatest wrong I did to her. Because Metal is life. It is real music from real people with real emotions. And the only reason why it seems so violent is because it is just a reflection of what the world has become.\n\nOh who would I be right now without Parkway Drive, Falling in Reverse, Bring me the Horizon, August Burns Red, A Day to remember, In Flames and most of all The Architects. But the list goes on so much longer and I still have to many more to thank that I don't even know where to begin. [Casper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEcvU3fYpGA) also needs a special mention here and lately also [Lemur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Cg9GE_Kvs). Thank you for that Ralle.\n\nSo where do I want to go with all of this?\n\nWell.\n\nThis is not so easy to explain.\n\nSpirits are real. Spirits get reborn in people. Retards are not so much tards. Reborn would be more fitting.\n\nMy name is Ren\u00e9 Alessandro R\u00f6ser and apparently without my own knowledge in me lives Re the spirit of the sun. I am the one that can't be killed. Because I am the creator. \n\nSorry Kenny. I have no idea what is going to happen but I feel like this is where it ends.\n\nI left a lot of clues to myself without me realizing it. Reddit. Re-dd-it. Good one. Whoever came up with this. But there are many more. Everyone helped me. To finally start believing in myself again.\n\nAs a kid I had a dream about GME. A real dream where I dreamt of myself as a grown up investing in a stock. I forgot that dream soon and never thought of it. Until the beginning of this year. When it all came back to me. Everything.\n\nI think anybody that I grew up with me knew that I was this except for me. I shape the world around me in my mind. There are many like me. Maybe you realized it maybe you didn't but it is real.\n\nSomething tells me Elon has the spirit of the Mars in him. But I don't know. Just an assumption. \n\nBut what is most important, I found earth. Like literally. I found her spirit. And even though she is safe with me, people fucked her up a lot. And she doesn't really like you for it. She still doesn't fully believe me but I know that it is true. And the also had a dream when she was young about being exactly where she is right now. In this house with me. Even though she never knew this house existed.\n\nThe whole system is fucked up because the world is not what you believe it is. Everything is a lie.\n\nI am the shorts. Because what I believe becomes reality. But here where I live, literally nobody is believing in me. They all say I don't know what I am talking about. They need to do this because if they start to believe the truth, their ignorant way of living gets destroyed. \n\nHere in Germany literally everyone gets credit for everything. You are 20 years old, only have a small income and want a credit for a house for 500.000 Euro. Here you go.\n\nYou want to drive a Mercedes AMG C63s but you work in a factory line? No problem just sign here.\n\nYou want to know where the shorts are? Germany are the shorts. And it is the liars that use me to do this.\n\nI got reborn in this body to claim back this realm and give it to the people that live here peacefully without trying to destroy everything.\n\nI am the Driver. Literally. And in me lives the spirit of the Sun. \n\nI am gravity and I am about to pull you all in.\n\nTo put it into the words of Winston: [You are the generation born to witness the end of the world. Viva the underdogs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykzedo--Vk8) And I was part of this very crowd.\n\nAnd as I am pretty sure nobody ever thought that the sun would talk to you through reddit, here is my book of rules.\n\n1. Rule: Don't be a dick.\n\nNo more rules. Listen to Bill Burr he knows what he is talking about. Maybe not everything. He does go a bit overboard at times. But who wouldn't with these kind of parents. \n\nNobody is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. Forgive people. Be kind to one another. Be kind to yourself. By serving others you serve yourself. But never should you do anything that is morally wrong. Don't be a slave to others or yourself. Value moral and patience above anything else and your world will make itself whole.\n\n[Time to come back to nature. Back to each other. Back to earth.](https://preview.redd.it/dhwk0t07v8571.jpg?width=903&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8315875d50935c9cdc5af050ef8cdc1381a04822)", "source": "reddit", "author": "Dr1v3r00"}, {"content": "**The diamonds hands of apes are the hardest, strongest, substances on earth.

Hear me out . . . .**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In order to prove that the MOASS is a fact and not just a hypothesis, I propose a paradigm shift from diamond hands to nuclear pasta hands.**  A higher plane of consciousness, understanding, and enlightenment is necessary to achieve the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind. This paradigm shift would be like the difference between looking at a day-to-day chart of GME VS the following [chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrmid8/another_day_of_trading_sideways_perspective/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z4vgwj9w2571.jpg?width=939&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d4a4591a5b4723e69304b14101dc442c9fad7e5\n\n**If you used to go onto** r/wallstreetbets **regularly and you no longer do so, you have reached a higher plane of enlightenment and knowledge: the same can be said if you used to trade on Robinhood and now don't.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe term \"diamond hands\" originated in wallstreetbets. **In hindsight, wallstreetbets was the perfect place for a market maker like Citadel to infiltrate in order to encourage losses through option plays with payment-for-order-flow (PFOF). Robinhood was the perfect platform to promote this: in order to get approved for risky options on Robinhood (origin of \"GUH\"), all you needed was a pulse.  As we all know already, Robinhood innovated no-fee trading and forced all the other brokers out there to adopt the same policy, but free isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cfree.\u201d In the past, Citadel itself said that PFOF should be illegal. If a firm is selling order flow to the highest bidder, even though you are paying \u201czero commissions,\u201d you are not necessarily getting the best execution. PFOF was pioneered by Bernie Madoff, and it is illegal in places like Canada and UK. Why is PFOF legal in the United States?** You have reached higher levels of enlightenment if you have abandoned Robinhood for a legitimate broker like Fidelity and if you have abandoned wallstreetbets for Superstonk (I do realize that the PFOF battle is not over yet). Diamonds hands--to not sell whether you were down 99% or up even up 100% to make as much profit as possible--were forged in the darkness of wallstreetbets: molded by it. It's time to come into the light of Superstonk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's difficult to change (at least temporarily) something so beloved and popular like the term \"diamond hands.\" The term \"diamond hands\" has infiltrated our vernacular and achieved viral meme status. People have tattoos of the wallstreetbets mascot holding diamonds. Diamond hands (in text and emoticon) have appeared in billboards all across the United States, including Times Square. CNBC reported that Musk tweeted out a diamonds hands emoji. **A paradigm shift is a dramatic change in the paradigm of a scientific community or a change from one scientific paradigm to another**: one of the most famous ones was the emergence of general relativity. In fact, Einstein thought that black holes and quantum mechanics were too weird to be true; nevertheless, the data, math, and facts kept pointing to the existence of black holes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of us have doubted the MOASS at one time or another: \"we are in a simulation,\" \"it could never happen to me,\" etc. Did you know that Einstein doubted his own theories? It may seem an unlikely charge to levy against the greatest scientific visionary of modern times, but even Einstein had his limits. Despite the extraordinary intuitive leaps he made, he often found himself unable to see what lay beyond his basic insights. As a result, many of the most stunning ideas associated with the theory of relativity were developed not by Einstein but by other scientists interpreting his work. In quantum physics, too, Einstein set out the fundamental concepts but initially failed to recognize where they would lead. And in his final, grandest search for a theory that unified all of physics, he simply never moved far enough beyond the math and science he had learned during his student years. More surprising, Einstein resisted the full implications of his work even after those implications were pointed out to him. Repeatedly he sought to undercut many of his colleagues\u2019 interpretations or to explain them away because they seemed too absurd to be true. These rejections recall the words of Arthur Eddington, a brilliant British physicist and one of Einstein\u2019s most tireless champions: \u201cNot only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we *can* imagine.\u201d One of history\u2019s most expansive minds was no match for the boundless oddity of nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/einstein-didnt-grok-his-own-revolution](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/einstein-didnt-grok-his-own-revolution)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is why the phrase \"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics\" exists. Einstein was born on March 14, 1879. More than a century-and-a-half after his birth, Nobel prize winners are still proving Einstein's theories to be true: LIGO, Large Hadron Collider, [black hole research](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/panel-announce-2020-nobel-prize-physics-73445602), etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave we seen short squeezes in the past? Yes. Have we ever seen a MOASS? No. Have we seen theories that support the existence of black holes? Yes. Have we ever seen a black hole? . . . [*Yes*](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/black-hole) (pretty much). Every day, more evidence accumulates to further support the existence of black holes, and **every day, more evidence accumulates to further support the existence of a MOASS happening in the future (including the recent shareholder vote confirming GME having more than 100% short interest).** However, scientists never settle on something as absolutely known until it's absolutely known, and there is still work to be done. I will continue to do my part and buy and hold GME shares and not sell until the price of GME is at least $10 - $20 million USD dollars per share:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSamaya Nissanke: \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say most of the community believe that we are seeing black holes, but I don\u2019t think we should ever sort of sit back and say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s done and dusted.\u2019\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe journey from an idea to knowledge is not one that has a clearly defined beginning or end. And this continuing quest is what defines the march of science towards the known.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://astronomy.com/news/2021/01/how-black-holes-morphed-from-theory-to-reality](https://astronomy.com/news/2021/01/how-black-holes-morphed-from-theory-to-reality)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore than a century ago, the person who discovered the possible existence of black holes didn't even really believe that they existed. Like that discovermagazine article said, \"many of the most stunning ideas associated with the theory of relativity were developed not by Einstein but by other scientists interpreting his work.\" Like Wikipedia, r/GME and r/Superstonk emerged through crowdsourcing information and is quite possibly the second-most important crowdsourcing project in the history of the internet behind Wikipedia. **It's possible that Dr. Michael Burry is the first one who discovered the possibility of the MOASS. DeepFuckingValue** [admitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsmbnk/a_look_back_at_what_michael_burry_knew/) **he YOLO'd into GME in the first place because of Dr. Burry, and DFV tried to reverse engineer how Dr. Burry came to the decision of making GME his** [**largest shareholding**](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116203522/https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM) **late in 2020.** Ryan Cohen also somehow figures into the big bang period of the MOASS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time that Dr. Burry developed his GME hypothesis, he didn't know that apes existed . . . or could exist. Although Dr. Burry started this groundbreaking, revolutionary research, he has sold his stake in GME for whatever reason: we apes now boldly and proudly take it from here. Everything we are doing right at this moment is unprecedented: every second you are alive participating in the MOASS is history-making. Every DD contributed to this subreddit, including the hedgefund / market maker-killing House of Cards by u/atobitt (The Annus mirabilis papers of r/Superstonk), further strengthens the evidence for a MOASS. **We are now more sure than ever that black holes exist and that the short interest in GME is &gt; 100%.** Due to all the people who have contributed to r/GME and r/Superstonk (atobitt will get a Nobel-stonk Prize for his work on HOC), we have a lot of evidence that supports the possibility of a MOASS, but the work is not done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the market cap of Apple? Microsoft? Saudi Aramco? Amazon? These are questions people on earth would ask. If you want to go to the moon, Mars, or the edge of the known (or unknown) universe, you need nuclear pasta hands \u269b\ufe0f\ud83c\udf5d\ud83d\ude4c . A simple Google search of \"hardest substance in universe\" will get you results for nuclear pasta, which lies deep inside the crust of neutron stars. At this moment in history, nuclear pasta is theoretical and only postulated to exist. I am sure we we will one day prove it to be true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf everyone all sold our GME shares right at this moment, GME would drop back down to $15, the hedge funds would cover all their naked shorts at bargain prices, nothing about the stock market would change (except that MOASS's would never happen again),  we would all go home and continue to go to our 9-to-5's till the age of 65, \"live it up\" for 10-15 more years if we're lucky enough to have our health hold up, and then that's a wrap on your life. **Humans will never have another chance at another MOASS again.** I cannot tell you what to do. In my personal opinion, I think GME is a good stock to own, and I like it. In fact, I like it so much I will hold every share I own until GME reaches $10 -$20 million USD dollars per share. In order to do that, I will shift my consciousness to a higher level of Zen that will allow me to withstand a multitude of circuit breakers, thousands of dollars of volatility, and FUD warfare. On this higher plane of understanding, I will realize that **I am personally holding GME for a chance to truly save humanity: reverse the global warming climate crisis, disrupt the US financial system and thus enabling important businesses (like those for cancer research) to thrive, dismantle the oligarchy that is the US political system (which has a global influence), expose the corrupt nature of US journalism, etc.** This will only be possible with nuclear pasta hands \u269b\ufe0f\ud83c\udf5d\ud83d\ude4c .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It is not only my opinion but scientific fact that sociopaths and psychopaths are drawn to positions of power whether it be in business and finance, politics, etc. This is a fact of life, but I think at least once in the history of mankind these people deserve their comeuppance.** The ultra wealthy exist in a realm that you have not fathomed. I can list many examples, but here is just one: there was at a time during the pandemic when not only was there an international ventilator shortage but people in Texas were forced to choose [\"who is sent home to die\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starr-county-only-hospital-forced-to-choose-who-is-sent-home-to-die-as-icu-beds-reach-capacity/) as resources ran thin and people were turned away from the hospital because the ICU was full. **The ultra wealthy were either attempting and / or succeeding in getting their own personal ventilators helicopter-delivered** during a time when some hospitals were splitting one ventilator to treat more than one person. Full-featured ventilators can cost $30,000 - $50,000. It's questionable whether having your own personal ventilator would even be useful without the proper equipment, supplies, and Pulmonologists or ICU specialists to operate it. Some hospitals have one physician taking care of 14-20 patients in an ICU and are a lot of times taking on more patients than they should. Think about the drain of resources if a wealthy person took one ventilator and one Intensivist away from a hospital. More than 600,000 deaths have occurred in the United States because of the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Ken Griffin makes [$68M a month](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/03/ken-griffin-makes-68m-a-month-after-taxes-ex-wife-says.html) after taxes.

The truth is they've been working with me since before the r/Superstonk migration. These members include u/catto_del_fatto, u/grungromp, and u/Captain-Fan. They have worked meticulously and tirelessly to progress the Satori project from idea to manifest guardian ape-gel of Superstonk.\n\nAwhile ago, we added u/catto_del_fatto and he was able to study the sub from a moderator perspective. He has earned our trust and since then has been promoted to general mod permissions. As a result, the Satori team quickly became linked to the mod team, as they became more and more critical to the sub's makeup.\n\nIn the past few months, in addition to Satori, they have helped us identify FUD attacks, organize mod mail, and identify bad actors and true apes alike. I would be wrong to suggest they aren't already a critical aspect of our moderating practice, and therefore we mods voted with overwhelming support to do the next logical step: add them as moderators.\n\n**Please join the mod team in welcoming** u/grungromp **and** u/Captain-Fan **to the moderator team.** I have no doubt they will continue to bring incredible concepts to life, with more accuracy and reliability, as mods themselves. Congratulations!\n\nAlso, now they can't escape \\*maniacal laughter\\*\\*cough-cough\\*\n\n# Satori Approvals\n\n[SATORI DIRECTIVE: PR073CC 4P3](https://preview.redd.it/zg5j1yh465571.jpg?width=1332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6329324faa295c425e8975b0aec1e59b1821e9f)\n\nFor those unaware, Satori is a sophisticated program that we utilize as a subreddit to identify \"true apes\" and also \"bad actors\" or people who would otherwise spread FUD and harassing posts. As a result of this software, we have been able to introduce an approval process that adds members to the Approved Users list. These approved users can bypass the [karma and age limits imposed by automod](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/automod_info).\n\nWe realize there is some confusion about Satori, and we are working on clearing this up in a more reliable way. I just created a [wiki page for Satori](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/satori) and while it is currently **under construction** you can check back there for updates on the system. This should help us streamline any questions and information, just as we do with [SuperstonkBot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/superstonkbot).\n\nAdditionally, you can check out u/grungromp's post, [**Satori: The One Week Security Update (Important Information Inside)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nva7nh/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), for a more recent update. The most critical aspect of this post is the new **!apeprove!** comment function, which means that any user, inside karma/age limits or not, can comment **!apeprove!** on any r/Superstonk post and be bumped to the top of the list. If your comment is immediately removed, I am told it will still work!\n\nWe have some limits imposed by Reddit, so the approvals are done in waves so as to work within this limits and Reddit policy. This **!apeprove!** function allows active users to essentially cut line. Make sure you use it! Spam will not be tolerated, though. Patience is key.\n\n# We... Us... \"The Movement\"... What is this?\n\n[We just apes.](https://preview.redd.it/jcufgqqb75571.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06768c4ac97561f9d1e02d46c39aaf6dd120412b)\n\nOkay, listen. We must follow Reddit policy, or they might take the sub down. We must follow actual laws, too, because god-forbid they do something evil like delist GameStop or implicate apes legally, as they did u/deepfuckingvalue. So, I am going to have to be a bit stern here and amplify a few things that I really think I need to amplify:\n\n1. Please view the DISCLAIMER associated with the subreddit. You can access it by going to r/Superstonk and (on Desktop) looking at the side bar, and (on Mobile) under the About menu.\n2. We do not manipulate the market. We do not coordinate anything regarding the stock market. We do not urge people to buy or sell, or do anything with what is their privately owned  stock. We do not shame people for their choices as retail investors, in an attempt to get them to hold when they don't want to, or to buy GME when they'd rather buy something else. We let retail investors make their own individual decisions. That's sub policy.\n3. We do not organize or attempt to push political action, or spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 or whatever some of you think this is. We are not going to organize letters to the SEC or otherwise enter ourselves into a political arena that we, trust me, do not want to enter. We are a bunch of apes who are bananas for GameStop and that's about it.\n4. We are here to share information, build a community, and express ourselves regarding GameStop as not just a stock, but also as a company, in way that is not pressuring or purposefully influential, and is based on fundamentals as well as market realities. If you don't want to talk about GameStop, there are plenty of other subs to go to, and, if you talk about GameStop, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the sub.\n5. TL;DR: We like the stock. We love the company. We are apes. That's about it.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that r/Superstonk was once a small little sub of just under 300 people before it exploded due to the Second Great Ape Migration. After that time, we got quite used to being the unknown sub that everyone needed to know. Well, we kept growing...\n\nWe know that big news stations, personalities and influencers, and likely GameStop themselves all keep track of us, so know that when you post content, it will be seen by people who might be writing negative-slant articles, or who might get on TV and talk negatively about us. I am not going to censor you or limit you, as this community will be as self-aware as it can be, I guess. I am suggesting that you maybe consider how your post or comment will bring unwanted attention or scrutiny to the sub.\n\nNo, I am not asking you to tone it down or \"behave\" for the big shots. Not at all. Have you seen my Twitter? Please. I am just reminding you of where we are. We aren't that little sub anymore. We have more online members than r/wallstreetbets these days. We are rising fast. Let's just be mindful of what negatives that can bring, if the right apes say the wrong things. I know you are all smooth brains but maybe, if you can spare adding a wrinkle, add one in this regard.\n\n# Superstonk Live: Monkey Business (stay tuned...)\n\n[Created by apes, about apes, for apes.](https://preview.redd.it/oukctkmx65571.png?width=4001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae7e8fa5859aea36119d68aad01c987b900b15d)\n\nThe mods are currently trying to put together a Monkey Business for the end of this week. The exact date is still in flux, but please comment below if you want to be considered as a participant in these panel-centric live streams, and an organizing mod may reach out to you. You do not need to be on camera, but you WILL need to be an active community member.\n\nWe have only done one episode of Monkey Business and [you can watch it here](https://youtu.be/UDKC_oXqhGM).\n\nPlease do NOT contact us directly, and trust that we will reference this post, or select them on our own accord based on behavior and interaction with the community.\n\nKeep an eye out for a post about specifics, or you can subscribe to [https://www.youtube.com/Superstonk](https://www.youtube.com/Superstonk) and watch for the stream.\n\n# Superstonk Awards Design Contest (stay tuned...)\n\n[I am giggling right now as I insert this photo.

Therefore, I feel I can be very strict and specific about all of the details \\*evil laughter\\* \\*cough\\* ahem.\n\nWe are going to be hosting a design contest to generate some Community Awards. You can [learn more about these awards here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/), but there will be a post early next week (or tomorrow) with all details and submission requirements.\n\nI can say currently that we will be using the bracket system that we used for the Banner Contest, and it will be a bit more streamlined and, well, faster. You will be submitting via email, so please create an anonymous email if you have not already, unless you don't care; I won't reveal anything either way, other than the design, name of award, and author by Reddit username. Also, the top eight will be receiving prizes, and ALL will receive mod-awards that give Premium membership. Stay tuned for more!\n\n*I honestly had hoped to make this post yesterday, but since I was feeling under the weather due to my second COVID-19 shot, there's a slight delay. Apologies! I am giving the other mods time to look at my details and give me feedback before I post, but I wanted to let you all know it's coming.*\n\n# Onward to Market Open\n\n[Make sure you drink lots of water!!! \\(or mead\\/ale\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2oddk4y585571.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0fb40f1881f57d39f76fedbc348471fd290f129)\n\nI also want to say real quick that the only thing we're pumping right now is my excitement and love for this community and the incredible mod team that I am so very lucky to have at my side. Never, ever, in a billion years, did I ever think r/Superstonk was going to reach these numbers (over 430,000) or beat r/wallstreetbets with online users. I mean, I joked about it, like \"Superstonk will be the next big thing! You just wait! I'll show you!\" but really I'm so smooth-brain it hurts so I never expected it for real.\n\nMy joke/dream was that I wanted to hear Fox News anchors say \"Superstonk\" out loud on national TV, and right now I can't even be sure they haven't already. This is truly remarkable and IMPRESSIVE. To the mods and the entire community, thank you for being the shit a.k.a. the bee's knees a.k.a. diamond-handed lunar apes a.k.a. the kickass OG badasses of reddit. Thank you for being here and making r/Superstonk the *best sub on reddit*. I am truly and eternally grateful.\n\nI am actually REALLY excited for market open and I have a gut feeling that we're going to see some crazy price action this week. Remember, trust DD over Red's gut... please... Just remember, a lot of what we're seeing is intended to discourage GME holders. If you like the stock, feel free to HODL it as long as you like. I personally will be.

Vi kommer for t\u00e5rene dine.\n\n# Intro\n\nThis post will give a *relatively* simplistic breakdown of the current situation and landscape of GameStop Stock, or GME as it is known on the New York Stock Exchange. It will summarize the theory that it will soon reach astronomical levels during a market, or the Mother of all Short Squeezes (MOASS) Thesis.\n\nThe core intention of the post is to summarize the MOASS Thesis and the key market concepts associated with it for investors who are not fully up to speed on it, as well as those who are newer to the stock market in general, and are interested in investing.\n\n**That being said, this writeup is NOT intended to serve as a source of proof/evidence behind this theory, and it operates under the assumption that the theory is valid and that the conditions it is built on are met.**\n\nFor those who intend to dig further into the evidence supporting the theory, there is a massive amount of research and due diligence on r/superstonk that has been performed and documented around this theory that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/njwv6n/the_gme_masters_guide_a_dd_campaign_for_apes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though it is recommended to use this post to get a basic understanding before digging into the Due Diligence.\n\nHere is the chart at time of last edit (6/7/2021)\n\n[Price breaking out BOLL Bands \\(key indicator that price movement is getting strong pressure upward\\)](https://preview.redd.it/imigm50evu371.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d269e45128a37586852f383e65346df656a5745)\n\n# Important terms to know before getting into the \u201cExplanation\u201d\n\nThese terms are key to understanding the theory and speculated value of a GME investment. Hyperlinks to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/), \"the world's leading source of financial content on the web\", have been included for most market terms and concepts and it is recommended to check them out if they are not clear. We will be breaking down some of the more complex terms and concepts within the post and framing them within the context of GME.\n\n## Long Position / Buying/Selling Stock\n\n* Not to be confused with a [long-term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterminvestments.asp) investment\n* When an investor buys a stock they are considered [long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) on it\n* In other words, holders of long positions have a **positive** number of shares\n* To [close](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) a long position the owner would sell their shares on the stock market\n\nThe basic idea behind obtaining long position is:\n\n1. Buy the stock\n2. Hold it until the price of it increases to a desired amount\n3. Sell it for a profit\n\nWhen people think about buying and selling stock they are generally talking about opening and closing long positions\n\n## Short Position / Shorting/Covering Stock\n\n* Not to be confused with a [short-term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorterminvestments.asp) investment\n* When a short seller shorts a stock they hold a [short position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) on the stock. This is essentially the polar opposite of a long positions (kinda)\n* Investors with short positions effectively are *in debt* or *owe* the number of shares that they have shorted and can be considered ***negative*** on the stock\n* To close that position, short-sellers must buy a number of shares equal to the size of their short position (buying to close a short position is known as [covering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp))\n* Short positions must be reported to regulators (unlike naked short sales)\n\nThe basic idea of obtaining a short position on a stock is:\n\n1. Borrow a share owned by a lender\n2. Sell the stock that was borrowed\n3. Gaining the cash based on the price it was at the time it was \u201cshorted\u201d\n4. Pay interest as a percentage of the stock's value\n5. Since this is a percentage the cost of interest increases if the stock's value increases\n6. Hold the position until the price has dropped to a desired price\n7. Buy the stock on the open market\n8. Ideally the stock is bought back at a lower price than originally borrowed for so the investor can pocket the difference\n9. Return the share back to the lender\n\n## The Float\n\n[The Float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp), or Floating Stock is the number of shares of stock that are available to be publicly traded (the number of [Outstanding shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) minus the amount of [Restricted shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) that are owned by insiders).\n\n* In theory, the number of shares owned by [retail investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) and [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) cannot exceed the float\n* SPOILER: GME is believed to have ownership amounting to 200% to 400% of the float if not more due to a something called [naked shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp), which is a key part of the thesis that is covered more later\n* GME\u2019s float total is currently \\~[56.89 Million](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/) shares\n* It is important to note that institutional investors own \\~25M-30M of the floating stock\n* If institutions were to hold during MOASS (not a guarantee though many are expected to), then the amount of shares publicly would be somewhere around \\~25M-30M. This means there would be even less supply when the short sellers finally have to cover\n\n## Retail Investors\n\n* Retail Investors, also known as individual investors, are your average investors (not a company or organization)\n* \"Dumb Money\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/haqavhb34v371.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8815fbf9c98e7d7ff6bcda1f121c318c6c5e0c66\n\n## Institutional Investors\n\n* Institutional Investors are organizations that invest on individuals' behalf\n* Examples of Institutional Investors\n* Endowment Funds\n* Commercial Banks\n* Mutual Funds\n* Hedge funds\n* Pension funds\n* Insurance companies\n\n[Just a couple of the \\\\\"good guys\\\\\" \\(there are many more \\\\\"bad guys\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/9yk0w1ywyu371.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205e9cfa487fe12d25ffc7425f3f9c0aff595817)\n\n## Market Makers\n\n&gt;I'd encourage you to read the Investopedia entry for them for more clarity\n\n* [Market Makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) are very different from \"Investors\" and are a bit harder to explain but basically are there to increase [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) in the market\n* When you buy and sell stock those trades are often going between you and a market maker\n* Market makers get \"special rules\" that enable them to keep liquidity in the market when there is low liquidity\n* Naked shorting is one of the options Market Makers have when navigating a trade that other investors do not have\n\n## Naked Shorting\n\n* Naked shorting effectively allows a Market Maker to short a stock without having a borrowed share like normal short selling\n* The result is similar to a short sale\n* Naked short sales do NOT have to be reported the same way as normal \"Short Sales\" and can be \"hidden\"\n* GME is expected to be shorted around two to four times the float, despite the fact that [Short Interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) only accounts for \\~20% of the float, meaning most of the shares are shorted via naked shorting\n* This type of trade illegal outside of specific situations involving Market Makers\n* Due to a loophole and lack of oversight by regulation, Naked short selling can be used to manipulate the price of certain stocks\n* Naked shorting was targeted for tighter regulation during the financial crisis of 2008 but enforcement has unfortunately not been effective in preventing it from manipulating the market\n\n[#NakedShorting](https://preview.redd.it/zmv6atr7wu371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63a9385035982eddffb0a06a848020379f383136)\n\n# Prime Brokers\n\n* A [**Prime**\\-**Broker**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primebrokerage.asp) is a bundled group of services that investment banks and other financial institutions offer to hedge funds and other large investment clients that need to be able to borrow securities or cash in order to engage in [netting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netting.asp) to achieve [absolute returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutereturn.asp)\n* Broker vs Prime Broker\n   * A broker is an individual or entity that facilitates the purchase or sale of securities, such as the buying or selling of stocks and bonds for an investment account.

Imagine I have $1,000 in stock\n2. You obtain a personal loan for another $1000\n3. To get the credit you stake your $1000 in stock (if you default it goes to the lender to cover your debt)\n4. You buy $1000 more stock with that loan (you now own $2000 in stocks, half in cash half on margin)\n5. You will pay interest on the $1000 on margin but if your investment makes more money than the interest then you are still profiting\n6. If your investment turns bad (lets say the price of your stock falls 50% and you are left with $1000) your lender can forcibly close out your positions (everything you bought in cash and staked as collateral along with what you bought on margin so that they can get the $1000 they loaned you back)\n\n## Margin Call\n\n* A Margin Call is a notice indicating you have a specific amount of time to deposit enough of your own funds to meet your margin requirement (if you cannot meet the requirement the lender is entitled to sell all of your holdings to recover what you borrowed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf25o9zu0v371.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=934a471bad29cb194afa7bb8f6dd40d222c57324\n\n**Examples:**\n\n&gt;This is a slightly complicated scenario that can be a little hard to follow. Give it a few reads if it doesn't make sense the first time, but basically, Margin is a credit line that you can use to buy more assets (effectively a loan backed by collateral and cash in your own account). If you buy assets with it, you have to pay back what you borrowed, whether the value of your investment goes up or down (if the investment goes up in value, you make more than you normally would, but if the investment goes down in value, you lose more than you otherwise would have without margin).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This gets even more (or less maybe) complicated when you have short positions AND long positions, like most institutional investors. To have short positions, I still need to have margin, but I do not need to use it to buy stocks, It can act as a buffer if I have a short position on a stock that is increasing in value (with a short position, if the price of something I short goes up, I am losing money), and if it gets too high, it can run against my margin line, causing a margin call.\n\n**Positive Margin Example (Long Positions only):**\n\n1. Imagine I have $1000 in stock XXX (let's say 10 shares worth $100 each)\n2. My broker may lend me margin credit line equal to the value of my assets (so $1000 in margin), and let's say they give me a margin requirement of $800, meaning that the value of my non-margin assets (the ones I bought with my money) must be above $800 in order to keep using margin (so as long as stock XXX stays above $80 a share, then I will not get a margin call for being below the requirement)\n3. I then choose to use the margin, buying 10 more shares of stock XXX for $100 each, so I now have 20 shares of stock XXX, valued at 100$ a piece\n4. If the price of stock XXX goes up to %25 per share, and I sell all 20 shares, I just profited $500 (+$25 on 20 shares)\n   1. In this case, closing the position clears me from the margin debt, as I am no longer using it in an open position\n   2. If I had not used margin, I would have only walked away with $250 in profit ($25 per share on 10 shares), but instead I made $500, and paid back the credit, plus a little bit of interest.\n5. Yay.\n\n**Negative Margin Example (Long Positions and Short Positions):**\n\n**THIS IS THE RELEVANT ONE TO GME**\n\n1. Imagine I have $1000 in stock XXX (let's say 10 shares worth $100 each)\n2. My broker may lend me margin credit line equal to the value of my assets (so $1000 in margin), and let's say they give me a margin requirement of $800, meaning that the value of my non-margin assets (the ones I bought with my money) must be above $800 in order to keep using margin\n3. Instead of using the margin to buy more, I instead short 10 shares of stock YYY which is at $50 a share currently (giving me $500 in extra cash), which I use to buy 5 more shares of stock X\n   1. I am now long 15 shares of stock XXX valued at $1500 and short 10 shares of stock YYY valued at -$500 (negative $500) for a net value of $1000\n   2. No margin is actively committed to open positions, and I am still using my $1000\n4. Now, lets say a short squeeze happens involving stock Y, causing the price to skyrocket to $200 per share\n   1. My short position is now -$2000 (10 shares of -$200 each)\n5. My net account value is now $-500 ($1500 - $2000) which is now using my margin, and because my account's value is no longer above $800, I no longer meet margin requirements so I get a margin call\n6. If I cannot balance my account, the lender will liquidate my $1500 in stock XXX in order to pay the -$2000 I owe, leaving me with -$500 left in debt\n   1. I have now defaulted, as I cannot pay the $500\n7. Now that I have defaulted, the lender who gave me margin owns my short positions, meaning they are now short whatever was left\n   1. The lender can now navigate the short positions however they want (they can hold them and hope the price goes down, and cover to close them, or they can close them immediately, costing them the whole $500 I still owed)\n8.

The amount of shares that are currently owned is theorized to range roughly between **200%-400%** of the float **if not more**, meaning that 100%-300% of the float has a corresponding short position (mostly naked shorts). For context, most stocks generally have around 1% Short Interest, and 10%-20% short interest is considered to be excessive, let alone over 100% of it.\n\nShort sellers must eventually close, or cover, their short position\n\n* The only way to do that is to buy the shares owned by the investors who are long\n   * in the meantime Short-sellers are paying interest on that short position until it is closed proportional to the cost of the shares, which bleeds their capital over time\n* Unfortunately for the short sellers, the owners of the shares **ARE NOT** obligated to sell their shares.\n   * The short-sellers, however, **ARE** obligated to buy in order to close their position (or else keep paying interest)\n\nSo what happens if no one is selling the shares they are \u201clong\u201d on, but short sellers need to buy them?\n\n* Supply and Demand\n   * With very little supply and high demand, the price of a stock can increase far beyond its fundamental value\n   * If short sellers receive a margin call due to no longer meeting their margin requirement and are unable to meet it in time, their assets will be forcibly liquidated by their lender in order to pay back the margin, as well as close out the position if the borrower defaults\n\nIf you are wondering why an organization would abusively short a stock like this if they eventually have to cover their positions:\n\n* If a company goes bankrupt or gets delisted from the stock market:\n   * The short sellers DO NOT have to close the position\n   * All of the proceeds from the short sale effectively disappear from their books\n   * They do not even have to pay taxes on this profit\n\nShort positions amount to the total number of long positions minus the float, meaning (based on the theorized range) that somewhere between \\~56-170 Million shares will need to be bought in order to close all short positions\n\n* It is expected that the members with short positions (hedge funds and market makers who have been naked shorting the stock) will be unable to cover their short positions, resulting in a situation where their lenders, all the way up to the clearinghouse (DTCC) will have to sort out the positions\n* If the DTCC/NSCC is forced to unwind the positions, it is widely believed that they will rapidly cover short positions at whatever price they are available for (this is how their systems are said to handle a member default), liquidating whatever assets are necessary from the defaulting member\n\n# Final thoughts...\n\nThis is the GME MOASS thesis. GME is a stock that stands to hit an unprecedented price point due to the fact that manipulators of the market have failed to bankrupt GameStop thanks in huge part  to [the Legendary Keith Gill AKA u/DeepFuckingValue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Gill), [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), and all of the GME investors who took part in this saga. It may not be today, this week, or even this month, but one day soon, these toxic participants have no choice but to buy the stock to close out their short positions.\n\nIn some schools of thought, it is thought that these participants over-estimated how \"reasonable\" retail investors can be (who could be dumb enough to hold a stock as it fell from almost $500 to $40?). In truth, these manipulators didn't understand the demographic they were fighting with. Gamers are some of the most stubborn people on the planet. These are individuals who will sink tens of thousands of hours into the same video game because \"they just like it\". Well, \"we like the stock\", and to us, the adversaries on Wall Street just are just another \"boss\". We may have needed to retry a couple times, but we always win eventually. On top of that, they pissed off reddit, and under no circumstances, should you ever piss off reddit.\n\nAt this point, if you are still reading this, know that it is up to you to decide your next move, whether that is to do some due diligence of your own, walk away, or say screw it and buy a few (or a lot of) shares just in case we are right. Many of us have set our floor (minimum amount of acceptable gains) at $20,000,000 per share, and you might think that is crazy, but in truth, we know we can pick our own price if we hold long enough. We don't care if anyone else buys or not, because we know the outcome is inevitable. Time is running out for the toxic market participants involved, and even the news can't hide that we are on the brink of a massive market event that will ripple through the entire global financial system, and we will probably never see an event like this again in our lifetime.\n\n**This is a fight Wall Street, Shitadel, Melvin Capital, and ever other toxic party is not going to win against the \"dumb money\"**. Chances are this will truly be \"**THE MOASS**\", meaning there will never be another like it in our lifetime (or ever). While the conditions in play (the ability for big money to brutally manipulate the market) enabled what may end up being the greatest transfer of wealth in history, actual reformation to prevent a landscape like this from forming again is probably best long term (I say this as a pragmatist, and am honestly very far from an idealist). If you want to influence reform, Buy, Hold, Vote. If you are just here for the tendies, Buy, Hold, Vote.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nToxic Market Participants and Hedge Funds have massive naked short positions open that they are unable to close because retail traders are refusing to sell. The FTD Cycle forces participants with naked short positions to obscure their short positions and uses bizarre options strategies to satisfy FTDs, which costs money to do. Since they cannot close these positions until retail traders sell, any participants who are subject to interest will continue paying it based on the interest rate and value of the stock. The Market Manipulators are just about out of capital, and new regulations and DTCC rules are making it more difficult for them to control the price movement of stocks like GME and AMC.\n\nEventually, the prices of these stocks will get so high that prime brokers will have no choice but to margin call these participants, who will likely be unable to settle all positions, causing them to default and make the prime broker take on the position. The prime brokers will then try to settle the positions, but if they are not able to unwind the positions either, they will default up to the NSCC, which will attempt to settle all positions they took on based on their Recovery and Wind-down Plan. If they cannot afford to close everything, they basically default to the Fed, who will most likely print money to address closing the positions.\n\nSuper TL;DR\n\nMargin calls happen everywhere and force all shorts to cover their positions or go bankrupt. The NSCC Omega Brrr Cluster liquefies all hedgies and covers as much GME, AMC, etc. as they can. If the NSCC cannot pay everything, it fails up to the Fed and JPOW to print money to get us out tendies and hedge fund tears.\n\n# Hedgies, velkommen til helvete. Vi kommer for t\u00e5rene dine.\n\n# Hedgies, welcome to hell.

My name is u/piece-friendly and I\u2019m a crayon eating apetard.\n\nY\u2019all ready for some of that sweet, sweet DD? \n\nBuckle up\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s get started at the beginning\u2026\n\nAs a quick intro, I\u2019ve been an investor in GME since January, I\u2019ve seen the rips and I\u2019ve seen the dips. In February, when u/deepfuckingvalue doubled down, I also did too. I have incredible faith in the turn around of GameStop, the new leadership team and their drive to give value to shareholders - this wonderful community I\u2019m proud to be in.\n\nDuring March and April I went fully tinfoil. I went down rabbit hole after rabbit hole, sponging everything I read, learning about new terminology, new processes and expanding my smooth brain and grew some wrinkles.\n\nSince May, I\u2019ve really taken a bit of a back seat and chilled out a bit, taking time to concentrate on my job, my pregnant gf, and a life I nearly blanked out through absolute commitment, some would say obsession, for the stonk.\n\nQuite recently I\u2019ve seen the likes of u/dlauer, Wes, Trimbo talking about the serious issues with the stock lending market, and I wanted to draw to your attention to some of the research I gathered some time back that should be known and more widely recognised. It\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve seen covered in many of the DDs from the likes of u/atobitt u/heyitspixel or others, but totally forms another part of a big ol\u2019puzzle.\n\nSo firstly for the smooth brains that don\u2019t read good, what\u2019s stock or securities lending?\n\n\u201cSecurities lending is the practice of loaning shares of stock, commodities, derivative contracts, or other securities to other investors or firms. Securities lending requires the borrower to put up collateral, whether cash, other securities, or a letter of credit.\n\nWhen a security is loaned, the title and the ownership are also transferred to the borrower. A loan fee, or borrow fee, is charged by a brokerage to a client for borrowing shares, along with any interest due related to the loan. The loan fee and interest are charged pursuant to a Securities Lending Agreement that must be completed before the stock is borrowed by a client. Holders of securities that are loaned receive a rebate from their brokerage. \n\nSecurities lending provides liquidity to markets, can generate additional interest income for long-term holders of securities, and allows for short-selling.\u201d (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp)\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this is a trillions of dollar industry where prime brokers are absolutely cleaning up. Lending securities for fees, rebates, interest fees, then using the securities against investors playing both sides of the court. Giving with one hand, taking with the other.\n\nAfter Burry released the collateral rehypothecation document in feb (https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm) it got me really interested in the failing system, so I dug in to find out what dodgy dealings could have been going on. For anyone looking to add a wrinkle, have a read. It\u2019s essentially why the repo and treasury markets are completely fucked, as the same toxic sludge gets lent, and re-lent, and re-borrowed, again and again, creating epic collateral chains and systemic risk, whilst making the books look just lovely.\n\nSo on my path in the securities lending market, I came across Equilend\u2026\n\n\u201cEquiLend is a securities lending platform started in late 2001[2] by a consortium of leading financial services institutions. Founding members include Barclays Global Investors, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, JPMorganChase, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, State Street, and UBS Warburg.\u201d - wiki.\n\nNow that got me interested. Some familiar faces there right? Some that might have blown up a bit in the 2008 financial meltdown?  Something not quite right here even to a complete retard.\n\nA consortium? So what\u2019s that exactly? \n\n\u201cA consortium is a group made up of two or more individuals, companies, or governments that work together to achieving a common objective\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the common objective here guys? Because from what I know now I think it\u2019s probably to make as much money as quickly as possible at the expense of a fair and free market\u2026 Fuck everyone else right?\n\nThere is relatively know information about this company, their wiki is like 3 paragraphs and guess what\u2019s in the last one?\n\n\u201cEquiLend and its prime broker owners are currently being sued in the Southern District of New York for antitrust violations. The case survived motion to dismiss in 2018\u201d\n\nYep, that\u2019s rights they\u2019re in the doghouse for antitrust issues. Pretty big ones I\u2019d say.\n\nDave Lauer and Wes\u2019 interview was a real eye opener and sort of drove me to make this post. Because this is bigger than Melvin, it\u2019s bigger than Kenny Mayo. They are getting a lot of shit, and quite rightly because the whole Citadel set up is a fucking scam. This goes beyond them and to the Prime Brokers (PBs). Then banks. Yep it\u2019s likely those fuckers again that are going to burn the house of cards again. As we saw in that lovely bit of DD that goes by that name.\n\nSo are they too big to fail again? That we will soon see I believe.\n\nAnyway, back to Equilend. \n\nSo what kind of shit have they been getting up to you ask? \n\nWell, I came across a class action from 2018 that I think y\u2019all gonna like. It\u2019s a pretty damning report. \n\nTo summarise it see the following exert on the case background:\n\n\u201cOn August 17, 2017, Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll PLLC and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP filed suit in the Southern District Court of New York alleging collusion among six of the world\u2019s largest investment banks to prevent modernization of the $1.7 trillion stock loan market. Plaintiffs, including the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, the Orange County Employees Retirement System and the Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, allege that Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS conspired to overcharge investors and maintain the power they hold over the stock loan market, obstructing multiple efforts to create competitive electronic exchanges that would benefit both stock lenders and borrowers. \n\nThe stock loan market is a critical component of a strong economy, enabling trading activities like short selling and hedging while also ensuring that financial systems operate efficiently. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit(\u2026)\u2014claim that investors who borrowed and lent stock through the stock lending market were and are being harmed because six investment banks took collective, illegal action to boycott, attack and acquire multiple entities who tried to increase competition and lower costs in the stock loan market.\n\nThe banks named as defendants in this suit routinely took steps together to block the development of competitive exchange platforms like AQS (in the United States) and SL-x (in Europe) and the impact of government regulatory reforms. For example: When the investments banks learned that Bank of New York was using AQS for stock loan transactions, Goldman Sachs threatened to return billions in collateral and never do business with BONY again. BONY promptly abandoned its plans. Various defendants took similar steps with well-known hedge funds too, including SAC Capital, Renaissance Capital, and others \u2013 telling them they would not connect them to an AQS, and, if they did not like it, they could take their business elsewhere.\n\nAs AQS\u2019s executives made the rounds of the stock lending industry and meeting with the organizations that would be part of the re-engineering of critical market infrastructure, one such institution openly stated that the AQS plan, \u201c[sounded] great, but who\u2019s going to start [your] car in the morning?\u201d\n\nWhen SL-x met with two Goldman Sachs executives to introduce them to an emerging product \u2013 one which would have threatened Defendants\u2019 dominance of the stock loan market \u2013 the Goldman executives were frank: if they were to allow a central trading platform with counterparty clearing, it would encourage other competitors to enter the stock lending market. \u201cI ain\u2019t supporting this,\u201d said Goldman Sachs Managing Director William Conley. \u201cYou ain\u2019t going to get this done,\u201d echoed Brad Levy, then Global Head of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Principal Strategic Investments Group.\n\nStock lending involves the temporary transfer of a stock from one investor to another, typically from large institutional investors who hold large amounts of publicly-traded securities (pension funds, mutual funds, university endowments, etc.) to entities who want to sell stock short. It is a common practice that helps both the borrowers and lenders of stock generate additional income in their portfolios.\n\nThe stock loan market has not kept pace with the technological progress that has improved other financial markets. Stock lending remains an opaque, over-the-counter (OTC) trading market in which there is no central marketplace for stock borrowers and lenders to trade directly with one another or see real-time pricing that could help secure better financial terms. Instead, stock lenders and borrowers must transact through intermediaries, also known as \u201cprime brokers,\u201d who take a massive cut of nearly every stock loan transaction. The six investment banks named in today\u2019s lawsuit are the dominant prime brokers in the U.S., effectively controlling the stock loan market and gobbling up approximately 60 percent of the revenues.\n\nThis suit alleges that, in order to protect their profits, these large investment banks have been conspiring since at least 2009 through a company called EquiLend, which they control, to prevent participants from accessing marketplaces where they could benefit from direct, all-to-all trading and thereby secure themselves the best prices. (All-to-all trading means that stock lenders can offer a stock to every other stock borrower in the market and select the best price.) Denying others this level of access forces trades in the market to go through their prime brokers, which is how the banks are able to reap tremendous financial benefit. In 2016, for example, these six institutions skimmed approximately 60 percent of the $9.15 billion in stock lending revenue alone, despite performing a service for which they bear virtually no risk. Any other arrangement would have substantially reduced the need for their services, and the premiums that they charge would have been untenable.\n\nThe coordinated effort by the prime brokers to stymie their competition in the stock lending market took numerous forms. After boycotting securities lending participants who participated on other platforms \u2014AQS in the U.S. and SL-x in Europe\u2014the banks either purchased the intellectual property underlying those exchanges (SL-x) or the exchange itself (AQS), effectively shelving the efforts to improve stock lending for investors. The purchase of AQS by bank-controlled EquiLend, which the last piece of the conspiratorial puzzle as it gave Defendants complete control over all gateways to central clearing in the U.S., even had a secret code name at Morgan Stanley \u2013 Project Gateway.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cohenmilstein.com/case-study/stock-loan-antitrust-litigation\n\nIt really is a fascinating case and rings all sorts of alarm bells in my mind. Collusion? Antitrust? Monopolisation? Competition law? These banks are literally running the show, boycotting and driving completion into the ground before buying up their tech and IP. Skimming huge profits, rehypothecating securities possibly over and over and over.\n\nDude, why the fuck can this be allowed to happen? \n\nMy only answer can be it\u2019s the power that they own, the money they move that can pay anyone off and put governments and federal reserves in their back pocket.\n\nI advise you to read the class action linked here - https://www.cohenmilstein.com/sites/default/files/2017-11-17%20Amended%20Complaint%20dckt%2073_0.pdf\n\nThe language used and the detail is actually quite shocking. \n\nWhistleblowers have come out and spoke. In the case that these banks call themselves the \u2019five families\u2019, likening themselves to a mafia style operation:\n\n\u201cRemarkably, in numerous private conversations, multiple personnel from the Prime Broker Defendants used the same phrasing to describe the stock loan operations of the Prime Broker Defendants collectively. \n\nSpecifically, these personnel characterized the Prime Broker Defendants as \u201cthe five families\u201d of the stock loan market\u2014a reference to the five major New York City organized crimes families of the Italian American Mafia.\n\nFor example, during a February 26, 2013 meeting with SL-x executives, one Credit Suisse director who was also an EquiLend board member explained that EquiLend was like \u201cthe mafia run by five crime families,\u201d and proceeded to explain that, as a result, nothing would happen in the market with regard to SL-x\u2019s platform unless the Prime Broker Defendants jointly allowed it to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn April 10, 2014, Credit Suisse managing director Shawn Sullivan recommended \u201cget[ting] all the members of the five families together\u201d to discuss AQS and related stock loan issues that had emerged in the wake of a recent regulatory development. \n\nOn another occasion, the head of securities lending at Bank of America similarly expressed an intent to convene a meeting of \u201cthe five families.\u201d The fact that multiple Prime Broker Defendants used the same mafia reference to describe themselves collectively shows that they knew they had formed an illegal cartel. Indeed, it indicates they were proud of it.\u201d\n\nYeah that\u2019s right, our \u2018trusted\u2019 banks are no better than a crime gang, monopolising and manipulating the market because they\u2019re \u2018too big to fail\u2019\n\nI won\u2019t cite the case anymore. It\u2019s 144 pages of gold dust that you should all have a look through it you\u2019re interested. But was enough for me to add another piece to this saga of the corrupt system we are living in. \n\nBut now we\u2019re all learning about it and the fucks won\u2019t get away with it for much longer. GGensler is coming in and I have faith that he\u2019ll bring about some reformation, it seems that\u2019s already begun.\n\nThis whole thing ties to the volume of dark pool and OTC trading we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s growing in recent years. That\u2019s routing trades unfairly and enabling MMs to manipulate and move markets, whilst Main Street bends over and gets fucked. \n\nAnd what\u2019s more, we know the treasury market is fucked right?\n\nWell guess what?\n\nhttps://www.pionline.com/ja/node/520076\n\n\u201cEquiLend adds Treasuries to lending portfolio\u201d in 2005. \n\nSo these mafia cocks are fucking it all up, pissing on our pensions and education and welfare, all for profit and control.\n\nNow if this ain\u2019t cause for a revolution then I don\u2019t know what is\u2026\n\nQuite a lot of info here guys, and I\u2019ve more to add and will be adding when I have time to further this research.

These systems not only do math, but they read language and can parse SEC filings, listen to AMA and even earnings conference calls. Using this data these, apparently unbiased, systems develop actionable insight for Shitadel and friends. These systems have been in development since the early 2000's and probably earlier. Shitadel likely has the deathstar of robo analysts and I bet they use it to generate FUD either in tandem with, or independent of their market manipulating activities (ladder attacks). The robo-generated FUD is fed to the boomer news casters that blast it all over the place.**\n\n# (1) Introduction\n\nThe FUD blasters like yahoo finance, Marketplace, CNBC, Motley Fool, and others tend to post articles in rapid succession in and around any event (manipulated or not) involving GME that could misconstrued, presented sensationally, or presented in a way that might be misleading to boomer day traders or investors.\n\nRemember when marketwatch published [this crap](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m27cjs/marketwatch_published_the_article_before_the_dip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) before that dip back on Mario day (3/10)? Remember the media's [silver campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8pe1/fake_news_market_manipulation_by_media_coomers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)? Anyone with the yahoo finance app sees all the FUD that comes and goes in relation to GME. There's so much negativity and predatory tactics in the media that /u/ayyyybro now has a [running list of all the FUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).\n\nI'm sure that each of these news sources have folks writing article after article after article to load in the FUD gun so that they never reach the bottom of the clip, but it's probably easier to let a machine do the FUDing. It would definitely be the path of least resistance, and it's better to work smart, not hard right apes!? HODL.\n\nThinking about all of this made me wonder about the prevalence of automated machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) based systems to (1) analyze past, current, and evolving stock market conditions, and to (2) push a media agenda of some kind, you know, to [control the narrative](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).\n\n[Jimmy talking about controlling the narrative](https://preview.redd.it/qkxszvwkqo471.png?width=304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fced0134cf19521cf94ebab8447a5f50ac54019b)\n\n# (2) Terminator 6/9: Rise of the Robo Analysts\n\n**(2.A) Human and automated market analysts**\n\nAny institution turning a profit in the stock market relies on market and security analysis to provide recommendations and predictions on trading or investment decisions. If you're big enough you'll hire people to do it for you. Sometimes they'll look at fundamentals, scrape through SEC filings, sometimes they'll do TA, but at the end of the day these analysis procedures provide timely and actionable insight into making decisions in the market. The problem with human analysts though, is their throughput and inability to form connections between hundreds, potentially thousands of variables. With all the cloud computing platforms and buzz about ML and AI from the 90s until now, it would come as no surprise if people created automated systems to perform market and securities analysis.\n\n**(2.B) Who the hell is David Trainer**\n\nSo I was reading some more [FUD](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-slides-stock-sale-plan-081935532.html) \n\n[The FUD.](https://preview.redd.it/obbbyu6kro471.jpg?width=706&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84c9d551b7af2ef01b1bd127caf6c33dc80e1735)\n\nfor funziez the other day and I came across two names. The first is [Michael Prachter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pachter) which I dove a bit into in [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/nwxlbb/how_could_fud_be_bullish_check_this_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nCheck out this section of this \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 FUD article\n\n[Some FUD statements given by some dude named David Trainer.](https://preview.redd.it/d7bpmwjoro471.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfe65ca85c08b6d64a2e1d3c34cbd9f90473ccda)\n\nThe second was a dude, David Trainer, quoted in the article saying that the SEC **\"trading probe \\[into GME\\] is definitely a big red flag\"** and that this SEC investigation may be **\"the needle that can bust the balloon of the stock's valuation.\"** What else does it say about this guy? He's the founder and CEO of an investment research firm called **New Constructs**. If you head to the [about page](https://www.newconstructs.com/about-us/) on New Constructs website you'll find this blurb.\n\n[Check out those customers and where the company is featured!](https://preview.redd.it/4acz8s2aso471.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f086d099060e5a265087a1f4a61b9cb16c63ff39)\n\n**(2.C) New Constructs - the FUD terminator factory**\n\nNew Constructs **\"leverages the latest in machine learning to analyze structured and unstructured financial data with unrivaled speed and accuracy to become one of the top investment research firms in the nation.\"** Well shit, I guess Jimmy Fiddles, market analyst for broker X, just got his ass beat by a MFing robo analyst. Mr. fiddles better start preparing for unemployment! I'm pretty sure non-sentient robot's only give a shit about what you program them to give a shit about. If the creator imbues them with biases and external FUD opinions, then that's what these robos will prefer to deliver, \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 FUD. Oh, and these robo analysts will sift through more 13Fs in a day than Jimmy Fiddles could go through in a decade.\n\nSo the CEO of this robo analyst making company is regularly being interviewed by FUDing news sources, and his company's robo analysts are regularly being used by a number of huge players in the GME saga, probably Shitadel and friends as well.\n\nLooks like we got ourselves an automated FUD blasting terminator ... New Constructs.\n\nWell how regularly does David Trainer and/or New Constructs pop up in the media and stock news you ask? Well you can check out [where they've popped up in the news](https://www.newconstructs.com/about-us-old/new-constructs-news-media-appearances/) on their website! After filtering the listing by GameStop you get the following.\n\n[Wow, that's a lot of news!](https://preview.redd.it/22qltb0jto471.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d1c1501d286de4536b363bae19810cb4820f96)\n\nWowee! Do any of you smooth brained apes recognize any of these articles? It looks like these robo analysts show up in most of our favorite FUD articles! Cool! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\n**(2.D) How good are these robo analyst FUD generators?**\n\nNaturally, it's worth determining how good these robo analysts actually are. Check [this article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3514879) out called *Human versus Machine: A Comparison of Robo-Analyst and Traditional Research Analyst Investment Recommendations*. Poor Mr. Fiddles, he's being put on the spot only to get fucking buried by these robo analysts. Give the article a read for yourself if you want. It's a long read, but I think it's worth it. I'll point out just a few things I've found.\n\n[What a world we live in.](https://preview.redd.it/m2ygpk51uo471.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cccad84b536e2f670105606e3a0f442107289aef)\n\nLet's dive into this article and uncover a few notable findings.\n\n**(2.D.1) Robo bias and what do these robos produce?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Robo analysts produce recommendations!](https://preview.redd.it/uln5pbn8uo471.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e80b19f337b21088c24ef2953e8cc3395ced59c8)\n\nLooks like robo analysts are less susceptible to biasing against stocks heavily shorted and/or naked shorted by Shitadel and friends! Well, maybe, but maybe not. If the product of these analysts are recommendations, then bias could be built into the cost benefit analysis part of an automated trade system. For example, the rule could just be: \n\n    if (stock == \"GME\")\n    {\n        RunFUDSmearCampaignWhileLadderAttacking();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Whatever();\n    }\n\n**(2.D.2) How many recommendations do these robo anals produce?**\n\n[Robo anals produce a lot more tendies than Jimmy.](https://preview.redd.it/g2melv56vo471.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2793dd7d2edf054652bce6eb3653afe7d37fec30)\n\nLooks like the robo analysts produce more revisions per firm per year than a human, \\*ahem\\* I mean, traditional analyst. Cool, so they react faster and more frequently. Next.\n\n**(2.D.3) What other scary shit can robo anals do?**\n\n[You know, nothing creepy, they swear.](https://preview.redd.it/u61ewjdbvo471.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915a60bd9c2c6ef906895b2485c4f3e814684e01)\n\nLooks like these things can listen in and form inferences on **\"earnings conference calls\"**. You better believe robo anal terminators are feeding hedgies tactics as we speak to battle the impending GME MOASS and GME's longterm growth. Just because the tone in the room of the call was positive doesn't mean good things, robo anals see right through BS apparently.\n\n**(2.D.4) All things considered, how well do robo anals perform?**\n\n[Man, Jimmy really sucks huh.](https://preview.redd.it/dkr1t2yzvo471.jpg?width=646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f651d3e83aff51a461b72b685f0797a4e85c8f8)\n\nPoor poor Mr. Fiddles, he's about to go from Jimmy Fiddles to Jimmy No Job Fiddles now that the robo anal terminator is predicting market trends better and faster then his slow human ass ever will. That's almost a factor of 3x better performance from the robo anal when compared to Jimmy's performance in the long term.\n\n**(2.D.5) Wait, New Construct is the only company making these right?**\n\nWrong. There's probably way more in existence than I'll introduce here, but there were several companies listed in this paper that provide a robo analyst product. Here's the list in case any of you curious \ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f sniffing apes need/want more info.\n\n1. Minkabu\n2. New Constructs\n3. Price Target\n4. Rapid Ratings\n5. [Thestreet.com](https://Thestreet.com)\n6. Validea\n7. ValuEngine\n\nIf you care to see, there's also an example report from two robo analyst making companies in the appendix of the paper. I highly encourage you to check them out.\n\n**(2.D.6) Is robo shorting a thing? Well, probably**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oh, so robo analyst downgrades aren't associated with increased short interest! I believe that for sure!](https://preview.redd.it/y20jaqagwo471.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86925a59efda5a2ed8e6fd00d51eb7c8bc7aed90)\n\nWhile this article acknowledges that human sell recommendations are more useful for SHF shorting strategizing, it notes that it finds no evidence that robo anal terminator sell recommendations lead to an increase in short interest. That's fantastic, but it does not rule out the possibility that robo anals could be enlisted by entities like Shitadel and friends to perform shorting actions on robo sell recommendations. And when shit hits the fan, they'll just blame it on the robo analysts and the need to have a competitive edge to survive. They'll say \"Well everyone was using this robo anal fintech. I mean, to stay afloat we had to adopt this tech.\"\n\n**(2.E) Some \"traditional\" speculation about Shitadel**\n\nRobo analysts are likely out there right now parsing the fuck out of SEC filings for thousands and thousands of public companies, establishing buy, sell, put, and call signals for hedgies and friends! Great. What about our friends at Shitadel? Oh, they have to be. First, check out this CNBC article posted back in March of 2017.\n\n[Four years ago and robo anal terminators were already winning!](https://preview.redd.it/50hvouzxwo471.png?width=925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd20d5b2a6934ab3a7d2f0b7a6b9458c967b739f)\n\nNow check out this paragraph from the article above.\n\n[\\\\\"the gap is definitely narrowing\\\\\" - some guy, 2017 -](https://preview.redd.it/jz43z2x2xo471.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e055d4eca3a75c5415f3fe1794092ae2d4c3879d)\n\nSo Shitadel was already using automated robo strategies for trading back in the 2002-2007 timeframe. They were there right from the start when ML, AI, and cloud computing became buzz words. They saw the opportunity to use it for maximizing alpha to the umpteenth degree and they probably exploited the shit out of these emerging technologies for financial gain. The article goes on to quote some boomer named Matt Hougan saying **\"In 10 years, the idea that we trusted human beings to pick stocks will seem absurd,\"** well Matt, we are 4 years into the ten you made your prediction for and I gotta say, I think you're right.\n\nIf you go to Shitadel's job postings you'll see some interesting openings right now. For example, they have an open position for a quantitative developer. Here is the description.\n\n[That's some set of skills you're looking for Kenny boy!](https://preview.redd.it/w2gaafwkxo471.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad392fdbb19e24813c6a8cad956123cc45f0a5c9)\n\nLet me share how I read this description. They want some smart ass person to develop (or probably just fine tune at this point) alpha or (buy/sell) signal generation software that can be massively distributed (probably on the cloud, or in clusters strategically positioned near exchanges). These systems should use natural language processing (NLP) to probably scan reddit, twitter, etc. for sentiment, scan the SEC filings for buy/sell/SHORT signal generation, and most certainly generate content to feed news outlets that actively paint the desired narrative for SHF boomer \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08s. They want someone who can develop an extensible platform so future smarties can come in and add more robo anal terminator functionality. It goes without saying, this person should be a fucking legend at math, quant finance, and analytical analysis. Shitadel wants to future proof their automated deathstar robo anal terminator. I mean it says it in the opportunity description, \\*\\*\"Build automated ETL pipelines to support rapid but controlled transition from research to live trading\"\\*\\*. So Shitadel for sure has a robo analysts army doing their bidding, which is constantly being upgraded by their revolving door of smarties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kenny G's robo anal terminator deathstar.](https://preview.redd.it/xk4b4120zo471.jpg?width=220&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f581bdf8e4c4cc2181a504438978225bb2a983b)\n\nCheck out this cheeky short article describing the success of Kenny's robo deathstar.\n\n[Kenny boi is \\\\\"probably okay\\\\\" with his business.](https://preview.redd.it/mb0ffn64zo471.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3521261e5655cc5f84b7cb12f2e1a4e1350e718f)\n\nNow look at this 2017 Reuters article talking about the \\*cost of doing business\\*.\n\n[The cost of doing business.](https://preview.redd.it/l40zonb8zo471.jpg?width=673&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8cba1071aa1b1060d95e12c8aae2a400d237ee5)\n\nCool beans.\n\n# (3) Conclusions\n\nWell this is as far as I choose to go down the rabbit hole today. I haven't dug into how NLP could be used to automatically generate FUD, but it does not seem that far-fetched given the existence of robo anal terminators. I'm sure it's being done. The deathstar then\n\n1. Analyzes the market\n2. Buys, sells, shorts, naked shorts, and does it ahead of you at a better Price\n3. Determines if the market is going in wrong direction.

Yes, these men are innovators and have changed society for the better, but at what cost? Did you know that Tesla and Elon Musk have children mine Lithium in foreign nations just to decrease costs of production for their batteries? I encourage you to remove the blinders from in front of yourselves and look at the world from a Birdseye POV.\n\n**THE WKHS TRADE**\n\n**APE TRADE LOGIC AND WKHS SHORT INTEREST (FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE)**\n\n* For those of you new to this trading scene, there are certain laws that reside in the stock market. Let's call them the laws of physics within the market. \n* Based on analytical data, WKHS has a short interest of over 50%.\n* Given that like I stated above, the market must abide by its own reality, its own laws of physics. So the fact that over 50% is short essentially changes the gravitation field of the market, giving it a natural upward attraction when the hedgies start panicking. \n* If we can garner enough apes to rally the Army. The stock doubles in seconds.\n\n**Now, the logic behind the trade. Before the wealthy elite and 1% absolutely fuck the middle class from hyperinflation, hear out my idea. Quite simply put.**\n\n* Sell out of 5-20% of your long portfolio positions which are already inflated to absolute hell.\n* Place the proceeds in WKHS. A short interest of over 50% with a market cap of 2 Billion.\n* HODL THE STOCK AND NEVER SELL. THE ACTUAL STOCK IS OUR LEVERAGE, OPTIONS ARE NOT.\n\n**Now, THE MATH OF THE SQUEEZE.**\n\n* Given that roughly 90% of the expiration dates for WKHS contracts that are currently written, are under $35 strikes, we can flood money into WKHS causing the market cap to double instantly putting us almost past our last price hurdle. \n* If we double the market cap quick enough and HODL, we own all of the leverage. Because like I mentioned above with the GME analogy, there are hedgies out there renting WKHS stock, not owning it, not supporting the company, just simply \"renting\" WKHS stock through derivatives, then collecting the contract premium you Apes have been paying for their own personal gain.\n\n**OUR CORRUPT POLITICIANS AND GOVERNMENT**\n\n* Before the wealthy elite and Wallstreet nobility drop the market from hyperinflation of assets like they did at the start of Covid-19 for obviously different reasons (remember those beautiful Senate politicians selling out before anyone else knew of Covid-19, [https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market)). They do this kind of stuff daily.\n* Or how about Speakers of Our House like Nancy Pelosi buying Tesla calls because they have inside information in the government ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-buys-tesla-calls-191017279.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-buys-tesla-calls-191017279.html)). She pocked a cool couple million. And/or can just write bills that positively influence whatever they need for personal agenda. \n\n\\*\\* these are just two random examples of the many\\*\\*\n\n* The mass media manipulation through social media and news is outrageous.\n* Everyone and their mother has heard about MEME stocks now. Why you may ask?? Because they want idiots to throw money in blind why they make all the money back they lost originally shorting it through collecting any type of premium on option derivatives. Originally GME hype started out as a position that was completely over leveraged. If you know anything about the market, people were pretty much selling stock they didn't even own through underlying option derivatives. For the average person who doesn't trade/know anything on options, hedge funds were doing the equivalent of renting out your house (that you own and have paid off) without telling you while you weren't home, then pocketing the rent money and moving along before you have any idea what just happened. Trust me it happens every minute of every day when the market is open.\n\n**CRYPTO AND \"THE GREAT RESET\"**\n\n* I highly urge those who are unfamiliar with the Great Depression to do a little research and see some of the current similarities we are living through. Like in the late 1920's much like now we can see the distortion from reality of the investors minds and logic, which the elite are thriving off of. Thinking stocks only go up never down. Well, news flash, the market much like our reality, \"what goes up must come down\".\n* I strongly believe we are going to experience a Great Reset and distortion of wealth here shortly.\n* I like crypto, I'm invested in BTC and ETH. I full heartedly understand the concept and what they are trying to expose, but like any FIAT currency they all have their downfalls.\n* Micro and macroeconomics go hand in hand, and with the expansion of crypto and e-wallets people are failing to realize that for the vast majority of the world, 90% can't even afford it. You need a phone, computer, tablet, etc device to access it. For many in these developing nations, the cost for buying a device just to use crypto on, in many cases, exceeds one year of income. Yes, ONE YEAR! I'm aware, you can make the argument that their purchasing power is different (product in their nation cost less USD), but the fact of the matter is income inequality is going to reset drastically, furthering the gap between the haves and the have nots.\n\n**INFLATION FEARS \\*\\*TRANSITORY OF COURSE\\*\\*** \n\n* We have wealthy individuals (top 1-10%) telling us to not worry about inflation. Just an FYI kids, when someone tells you not to worry about it, especially someone in a higher caste than you, you better start running the other direction. We have a volatility hedge (VIX) in the market that implies otherwise. In fact, the opposite. This hedge represents hyperinflation ensuing mid July and I want every last one of you be be aware, because the world wants a bunch of sheep running around still playing their same stupid ass games. Look at the image below, notice how there in no volatility hedges the week previously?? MARKET CRASHES ARE ORCHESTRATED BY THE WEALTHIEST ELITE TO ACCUMULATE MORE POWER AND FURTHER THEIR POSITIONS IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES!\n\n[VIX HEDGE FOR JULY 21, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/7iy3tvj9um471.png?width=5119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b2bb322978ac10a6a18196afd928fc447c2d4a)\n\n* This time we are better. Smarter, Stronger, Wiser. You also might be aware that the CPI data that came out yesterday shows inflation has increases the most in over 10 years. Now, yes, you can argue that we are return to pre pandemic levels and the economy by definition is picking up. But as the statement goes, **\"NOTHING IS FREE IN THIS LIFE.\" THE DOTCOM BUBBLE, 2008, AND NOW. THESE EVENTS ARE ORCHESTRATED BY THE WEALTHIEST ELITE. WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK MICHAEL BURRY (A GUY THAT STARTED OUT AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR, WHO FOUND A CURIOUS NICHE FOR SHORTING MARKETS) FOUND OUT THE HOUSING MARKET WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL AND FAILING TWO YEARS BEFORE IT WENT TO SHIT AND STARTED SHORTING IT!!! THE ELITE DON'T CARE HOW HARD THEY HAVE TO SQUASH THE MIDDLE CLASS TO INCREASE THEIR POWER, THEY CAN COORDINATE A MARKET CRASH WHEN NECESSARY, AND THE TIME IS NEARING. GO CHECK BURRY'S HEDGE FUND CURRENT HOLDINGS AT SCION CAPITAL. THEY ARE SHORTING THE BOND MARKET TO THE DIRT, LOOK AT HIS TLT POSITIONS. ALL SHORT. FELLOW APES I CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR ONCE MORE. THIS IS YOUR WARNING TO HEDGE AGAINST THE ELITE AND COMBAT HYPERINFLATION. THIS MAN WAS ONCE A DOCTOR, AN ANALYTICAL NUT WITH A GOOD HEART FOR JUSTICE.

Today that self-imposed hiatus comes to an end as I make the somber decision to\u00a0resign my role as a SuperStonk Mod.\u00a0\u00a0I am also coming out of the shadows to share with you all my Authentic self: Who I am; What I believe in; and Where I hope progress, conviction and the current of life takes us all.\u00a0 I do these things not out of ego, but because to not do so would create a duality - a duplicity - that I don't want to live in, or with - a Stonk me and an IRL me.  So, I must step back from my role here, to step forward to serve Apes with my Work going forward.\u00a0  \u00a0\n\n[I'll Drink to That](https://preview.redd.it/dtbkkh8j7h471.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff99e91d499663cd149bf12a6d716cebcbf7b03c)\n\n# Fuck the FUD. Thank you, Mods.\n\nAfter this week's concerted FUD campaign against Mods I wanted to take a moment to peel back the\u00a0curtain and let you know what it's like to be a Mod at SuperStonk.\u00a0 First, the work Mods do for this sub is intense and what we face, literally, seems beyond sane at times.  The bizarre, shifting, divisive and calculated FUD campaigns are never ending. The stakes are high. Everyone's emotions are on edge.\u00a0 With this backdrop, Mods serve Apes tirelessly day in and day out to do justice to the\u00a0faith this Community puts in them. \n\nMost Mod work is unseen by design and therefor by structure and definition it is thankless work. And though they are and must be public\u00a0figures at times, they remain modest as best possible. Mods know they are not \"other than\", they are Apes first, Mods second.  It's a core value and shared ideal of all Mods.  But Mods' work and unique commitment\u00a0to this sub and community should be recognized, respected and appreciated for what it is - dedicated and selfless.\u00a0 So thank a Mod today, and tomorrow, and be patient with them everyday.  They work FOR you, and for your\u00a0families, and your dreams. \u00a0\n\n[A difficult choice.](https://preview.redd.it/yxoja9jn7h471.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68aaa5f9ba8e7721fb17bcff81b7c255414dd791)\n\nAs one of a handful of moderators here at SuperStonk on that first fateful Sunday, I watched this Community grow from 1 to 100,000 in 24 hours, and grow to, as I'm writing this, 420,069+ members. (Coincidently, on[ 4/20 my Karma hit 69,420](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv3mrv/nfw_i_sign_off_for_a_few_hours_and_come_back_to/) *Simulation* *Double* *Confirmed* \ud83e\udd2f)  But over these many short days, and endlessly long months, this Community has grown not only in numbers but in resolve, strength, intelligence, integrity and in common bond.\u00a0 \n\nSuperStonk, by the luck of circumstance and by the hard work of design, has become a sub-reddit unlike any before it.  A Community like no other.  It is veritable and virtual city of Athens - where Ideas reign and Ideals bond.  Mods and Apes at SuperStonk are guided by shared beliefs of individual empowerment, education, information, creativity and mutual respect.  And a pursuit of prosperity.  Simply put: We just like the stock, and each other.  These foundational Ideas and Ideals give this Community its unique strength. And they are the result of the promise of seeds planted in those early days, having now matured into this shrewdness of evolved, global, and diverse Apes. **You**. \u00a0\n\nI helped recruit and build this Mod team, and I am comfortable stepping back in part because I know that those at this sub's helm -\u00a0u/pinkcatsonacid, u/bye_triangle, u/redchessqueen99 and u/rensole,\u00a0and every moderator -\u00a0have the True North of Valhalla in their sights and Apes\u2019 best interests in their hearts.\u00a0 With this truly world class team, Apes are well served and protected.\n\n[ Hang a right at the second shitpost - and head straight on 'til morning.](https://preview.redd.it/ld4u1nzs7h471.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=633d2f8c8a567efe66d3065181cb1c911b1bc25d)\n\n# Two Steps Forward: First, into the Light\n\nStepping back from my Mod role was not an easy decision to make, but it was the right one for me ... so that I can take two steps forward.\u00a0 First into the light, and then into the fight.  By submitting my\u00a0hiatus notice weeks ago, and by now resigning my Mod\u00a0role at SuperStonk, I am free to\u00a0help advance the Ape's interests in other ways that more directly pull upon my personal and professional experience, without the veil and clumsy cloak of anonymity. \n\nI admire the bravery and courage of those willing to step forward into the light to fight, luminaries like [Dr. Trimbath (forever Queen Kong)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1bles/new_link_for_dr_trimbath_ama/), u/dlauer, [Wes Christian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfs6s2/rsuperstonk_live_wes_christian_may_18_2021_watch/), Lucy Komisar and [Carl Hagberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb36ig/thats_an_injustice_in_itself_that_were_letting/), and moderators like u/atobitt, u/pinkcatsonacid, u/jsmar19, u/sharkbaitlol and others.  \n\nAnd despite the concerns, and potential real-world consequences, I am unafraid.\u00a0I'm leaning in.\n\nI am [unafraid of trolls and shills](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj699j/to_the_paid_shrills_and_pimps_i_hope_you_checked/); I fed shills to baby Satori to help it grow. I am unafraid of hedgies; I\u2019ve looked them in the eyes and seen their sins, and there are many.\u00a0\u00a0And - most of all - [I am unafraid of the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcxhzd/lets_get_something_clear_sharing_a_wellfounded/); truth is knowledge, and knowledge is power. So I embrace the truth to lean\u00a0into this fight for equity in markets, structural and systemic fairness, and EQUAL ACCESS to information. So, here is who I am, and my path to this moment - this is my truth. \n\n[Existential. I have a very particular set of skills ...](https://preview.redd.it/svbnqi108h471.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edce389b53b6c151a1bff14d85e94c67a14ddc87)\n\n# Never Forget Where You Come From\n\nFirst, and above all, I am a husband and father to three brilliant little girls, and I care deeply about my family's future.  My values were shaped by my parents, two NYC public school teachers, and through their\u00a0experiences and eyes I long witnessed the inequities of the educational system.  My grandparents were immigrants, short-haul truck drivers, and struggling business owners.  They toiled within debt systems that doomed them to a life of indentured poverty.  I know that I am fortunate, because of their struggle and sacrifice I had a precious and rare opportunity to reach up and grab - to seize - the American Dream. And I did not waste my chance.\u00a0 Diamond Fucking Hands.\n\nMy path to professional success was not paved by connections or wealth, but built upon a deep and foundational reservoir of focus, industriousness and creativity.  My path went from from community college to the Ivy League.  From staff to professional.  From follower to founder.  Along the way I have been a Humanitarian - delivering food and medicine in Belarus to child victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  I have been a high school biology Teacher in the Bronx - witnessing the inequities of education first hand.  I have been a Lawyer at a top global firm, first as a peon underlying and then - through sheer force of will - winning a seat at tables of influence no young professional can imagine, nor expect.  And - now - I have been a SuperStonk Mod, during an unprecedented global Intellectual Rebellion.\n\n[The Power of APEs. The Power of People.](https://preview.redd.it/i70w63znih471.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a62d2a03639b6689ccea5cce42b9c02bd379a03e)\n\nAt the peak of my legal career I left.  I recognized that I had lost sight of my humanitarian values and my charitable roots but, thankfully, not my memory of them.  So I cast off from the calm and comfort of being a working professional and entered the choppy and uncharted waters of social entrepreneurship.  I wanted to build the world I hoped for my daughters.  I wanted to align my passion and purpose.  So - with much work - I did.\n\nShortly after I left the law I founded a tech startup named TwentyTables. TwentyTables\u2019 mission was to tackle food insecurity head on, by designing new, tech-enabled, synergistic, vertically integrated systems that could provide low-cost high-quality meals *en mas*.\u00a0\u00a0TwentyTables provided affordable food to those who often couldn\u2019t access it, and donated meals to those who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u00a0\u00a0Over the ensuing 4 years, TwentyTables employed 20 amazing people, served hundreds of thousands of meals, and helped feed tens of thousands of hungry and homeless.  All bootstrapped without corporate funding.\n\n[ Just take a moment to ponder the fantastical implications.](https://preview.redd.it/zgcs7dh28h471.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d16d1ac1c6b20ace2fa46b5bc66531f4f855c9c)\n\nTwentyTables succeeded by building systems predicated on aligned incentives and by embedding structural dynamics where all prospered together. [\\*Somewhat like Dr. T's - unique - audiobook contract. Shout out to u/pinkcatsonacid!!\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n71vy9/apes_change_the_world_superstonk_is_donating_time/) From investor, to food distributor, to vendor, to paying customer, to charity, to food insecure family, Everyones' incentives were aligned to make the system pull in the same direction.  TwentyTables was a tech enabled business whose foundations comprised complementary aims and goals, not ones based on predatory practices.  THIS is the way.  This is how you make difficult - systemic - change REAL.  And it works.\u00a0\n\nAlong the way, TwentyTables received national awards and recognition for our work, but I more often think about the people I met, the smiles I shared, and the bellies we filled.\u00a0 I know we had a real and lasting impact.  And with TwentyTables I learned just how powerful an Idea aligning profit and purpose was - truly capitalism in its best form.\u00a0 And I learned that the Idea resonated at local food banks,\u00a0and in ivy halls.\u00a0 The Idea of aligned Prosperity was Universal, and Powerful.\n\n[US Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards: Best Corporate Steward \\(Sm\\/Md\\) \\(2020\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xoa7zygv8h471.jpg?width=2771&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cafc1c6303a928141a3a001acb277c3f95c72881)\n\nBut then, COVID hit and ... like so many other growing businesses ... COVID killed my company, scattered my employees, and faded the once shining - perhaps grandiose - vision I had of building a better, more efficient, more equitable food system. And gone was the vision for a better world I was building for my little girls.\u00a0 COVID ultimately took not only my company, but for many months it took away my purpose.  The good I had dedicated my life to bringing into this world was gone. It was a dark and isolated time for me.\u00a0 And but for the shining beacon of my family\u2019s love - and my dog's constant and unconditional companionship - I was a deeply lost individual.\u00a0\n\n**Lost.** [Until I found you, all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbd8nt/gme_roll_call_part_deux_are_you_hodling_raise/) **Damn, I love you Apes.**\n\n[Buy, HODL, Buckle Up!

So, I bought shares out of solidarity - 10 shares that first day - and my diamond\u00a0hands formed fast. [That\u00a0first week was brutal. Buy moar, HODL - this is the way](https://www.reddit.com/user/StonkU2/comments/ldeab4/committed_to_the_stonk_gme_week_one_so_yeah_it/) \\- and so I did, all the way down to that fateful Feb. 19 - when u/deepfuckingvalue doubled down.\u00a0 [GME launched off of $38.50, so, as compelled to, I began buying on the way up too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm3x2n/in_short_i_like_the_stock_dfv_same/).

I believe this is an Intellectual Rebellion waged by Apes against the status quo, fought in an age of ubiquitous but not universal Information, and where access to that knowledge\u00a0makes all the difference.\u00a0 For when Ideas and Data are the Slings and Arrows in the war for Change and\u00a0Prosperity, [Truth is both the ultimate Shield and Sword.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxhcnq/beware_phishing_scams_are_trying_to_steal_your/) \u00a0\n\n[Truth, knowledge, data, transparency, equity, community.](https://preview.redd.it/xdwelxh49h471.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=003b175b3b11a90b5419010d5e1b7dfda4f0bb2a)\n\nI am stepping back from my Moderator role today, but not away from this Community and I am not abandoning Apes - [not after coming all this way with you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdsmm/after_1_week_of_voting_5_brackets_128_submissions/) \\- but I'm stepping back because I believe I can serve you best going forward in the open, in a new\u00a0capacity that I hope to soon share.\u00a0 **But for this new role the veil of anonymity is cumbersome, and so today I stand in front of you all - exposed - prepared for your judgment, hoping to be recognized for the Ape that I am and the good person I aspire to be. This is who I am, my name is Alexander Ross Cohen.** \u00a0\n\n# [LINKEDIN PROFILE: ALEXANDER ROSS COHEN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-cohen-698661139/)\n\n[Just an Ape.](https://preview.redd.it/2z58bdda9h471.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=837820a73a0502a19b4abc1ae056f9eb9743592f)\n\nUltimately, at my core I am a\u00a0proud father and passionate builder of things, with a strong and anchored moral compass.  I hope in the not so distant future to share more with you, news of something exciting, something I started help building AFTER my hiatus began.  But that revelation will have to wait.\u00a0 For now. I am returning to my roots; walking side-by-side with my ape brethren on this strange, wonderous and winding path, stopping now and again to howl at the moon.\u00a0 Together compelled towards Enlightenment. Towards Information. Towards Community.\u00a0 Towards Change.\u00a0\n\n[I know.

And I\u2019ll close with this.**\u00a0 \n\nI believe the Power of Ideas is ultimate. *Ideas have the ability to persist long after canons rust, armies die, empires fade, and walls crumble.*  *Ideas have the ability to echo through the ages and inspire millions, and empower millions more.*  It is THIS community\u2019s uncapped curiosity and passionate pursuit of Ideas that has captured the passions of so many.  Sitting quietly with your computer, your phone, and your ideas, you have done ... all this.  But we are just getting started.  So I caution that the information that gives birth to and fosters these Ideas, these needed truths for an Intellectual Rebellion, is fiercely guarded and intentionally opaque. And if Ideas are Power, their accumulation - Knowledge - is prosperity. **I believe: To truly achieve fairness, equity, and equality in the markets, the walls surrounding Knowledge, Data, Community and Collaboration must come down - the playing field must be leveled broadly so that as Apes and All people may thrive.**  \n\n\n[Sunshine is the Best Antiseptic.](https://preview.redd.it/iopoq76s9h471.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f431a86d90020ee41ea06c4291429962400b18)\n\n**A reckoning of markets is coming,\u00a0catalyzed by individuals united in ideology and global in reach.**\u00a0 Lessons born from this moment will be taught for decades shared both by friends around firepits, and lecturers in ivy halls. You, Apes, you broke the wheel. You are showing the system for what it is. *Fundamentally Flawed. Abusive. Patently Unfair.* You seized your American Dream Moment with Diamond Fucking Hands. And you ARE the global movement.\u00a0 Apes.\u00a0 Strong.
